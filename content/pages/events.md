DIYnamics team members teach students at local schools and special
events about geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) and the use of
scientific models.  We bring rotating tanks for demonstrations of
topics such as the creation of vortices and weather patterns.  The
DIYnamics rotating tanks, being so cheap, portable, easy to assemble,
and easy to operate, enable every student to literally get their hands
wet by helping to perform the demonstrations themselves.

Check out [our blog](blog.html) for summaries and images
from our past events.  Still want to find out more, including how to
run your own event?  Reach out to us at
