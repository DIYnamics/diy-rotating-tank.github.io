## What are the LEGO-Based Tables?

{% img {static}../../images/kits/lego/technics_table_label.PNG 400 Technics Table complete setup with labels %}

*The LEGO-Based Tables are robust and affordable platforms for you to perform rotating tank experiments yourself!*

The LEGO-Based Tables are rotating tank platforms created using LEGOs and other household items for $80 or less. The tables provide a robust and affordable solution for performing rotating tank experiments that model geophysical fluid dynamics!

The tables are composed of the 1) LEGO assembly, 2) OXO lazy susan and 3) clear cylindrical tank. The tank is placed at the center of the lazy susan and filled with water. The LEGO assembly supports a horizontal drive wheel that contacts and rotates the lazy susan via a battery powered LEGO Power Functions motor.

The LEGO-Based Tables consist of 2 variants, the **LEGO Table** and the **Technics Table**, characterized by their LEGO assembly designs.

*The LEGO Table features a minimalist LEGO assembly.*

Developed in 2017, the first generation **LEGO Table** can be purchased in its entirety (LEGO assembly, lazy susan and tank) for **$55**. The LEGO Table was developed to fulfill our goals of providing a rotating tank platform accessible to as many classrooms as possible. Its LEGO assembly is composed of LEGO pieces to create a minimalist design.

*The Technics Table features a fortified LEGO assembly.*

Developed in 2020, the second generation **Technics Table** can be purchased in its entirety (LEGO assembly, lazy susan and tank) for **$80**. The Technics Table was developed incorporating feedback from the DIYnamics community's experiences with the LEGO Table. Its LEGO assembly utilizes Technics, a variety of LEGO, pieces to maintain stronger connections and a larger baseplate to improve stability. These improvements result in a design that is more complex but much more permanent than its predecessor.

Both the LEGO Table and Technics Table enable you to perform rotating tank experiments modeling fluid dynamics! Choose either design to perform your experiments. The LEGO Table remains a great option as our most inexpensive and easiest to build platform. However, especially for repeated or prolonged demonstrations, we've learned from users all over the world that it can sometimes be inconsistent. The Technics Table has greater upfront costs but its much improved rigidity results in a better overall experience -- the platform is more stable and less prone to losing contact or breaking during demonstrations. The DIYnamics community has developed add-ons that increase the functionality of both designs for stunning results!

## Customization Opportunities

The fun of LEGOs is that they provide endless opportunities for customization! Inspired by LEGOs, we approach the LEGO-Based Tables as modular designs open to improvements. Here are optional add-ons that build upon the core setup and improve its capabilities for performing experiments and capturing data. These add-ons were developed by the DIYnamics community and if you are interested in sharing your designs, please feel free to contact us via email at diynamicsteam@gmail.com or Twitter at @DIYnamicsTeam.

## Using an External Power Supply

The LEGO-Based Tables are powered by batteries driving the motor at a constant speed. The external power supply approach enables driving the motor using wall power and provides the ability to make fine adjustments to rotation rate. These features are beneficial for experiments such as Taylor Columns that require either a low rate of rotation or precisely changing speed mid-experiment. **Disclaimer: Be careful with experiments involving wall power and water in close proximity. We include a GFCI in the required components for safety.**

### [Guide to Setting Up the External Power Supply PDF]({static}../../pdfs/technics/External_Power_Supply_Guide.pdf)
This PDF describes how to assemble and use the external power supply. View the Technics Table Parts List PDF for a list of required components.

## Capturing Rotating Frame Footage

When the tank of the LEGO-Based Table is rapidly rotating, it can be hard to see the more subtle behaviors going on inside the tank. To get around this, it's really helpful to have a camera looking at the tank from above and spinning with the tank. The rotating frame camera mount provides this ability, what we call capturing footage in the rotating frame, for the LEGO-Based Tables. Zoom can be used to livestream rotating frame footage for real-time analysis of fluid motions.

This PDF describes how to mount a camera in the rotating frame above the tank. View the Technics Table Parts List PDF for a list of required components.

This PDF describes how to livestream footage from a phone in the rotating frame via Zoom.

## Switching Wheels

The LEGO-Based Tables offer the flexibility to switch wheels driving the lazy susan. Analogous to a higher gear ratio, using a larger wheel will increase rotation rate and vice versa. The Technics Table, designed to provide a more stable platform compared to its predecessor, features an adjustable arm that can be calibrated to different wheels.
