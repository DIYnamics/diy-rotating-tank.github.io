Title: The LEGO-Based Tables
Slug: lego

Experimenting with your own LEGO-Based Table is fun and easy!

Already have your table assembled and working? Head over to the [Teaching](/pages/teaching.html) page to learn how to incorporate it into the classroom. Otherwise, this page provides everything you need to know to order, build and operate one yourself.

## What are the LEGO-Based Tables?

{% img {static}../../images/kits/lego/technics_table.PNG 400 Technics Table complete setup %}

The LEGO-Based Tables are rotating tank platforms created using LEGOs and other household items for less than $100. The table provides a robust and cheap solution for performing rotating tank experiments that model geophysical fluid dynamics.

## New as of October 2020

The first generation of our LEGO-based rotating tank platform is known as the **LEGO Table**. We introduce the second generation known as the **Technics Table**. The second generation builds upon the first generation by using Technics components to maintain stronger connections and a large baseplate to improve stability. Each table's core setup consists of a LEGO assembly, lazy susan and tank and provides the materials needed to perform experiments. The Technics Table core setup can be purchased for $80 whilst the LEGO Table core setup can be purchased for $60.

Both the Technics and LEGO Tables enable you to perform rotating tank experiments modeling geophysical fluid dynamics. Although both carry out the same function, the Technics Table is much more resilient to breaking resulting in more consistent experiments.

## Customization Opportunities

The fun of LEGOs is that they provide endless opportunities for customization! Inspired by LEGOs, we approach the LEGO-Based Tables as modular designs open to improvements. Here are optional add-ons that build upon the core setup and improve its capabilities for performing experiments and capturing data. These add-ons were developed by the DIYnamics community and if you are interested in sharing your designs, please feel free to contact us via email at diynamicsteam@gmail.com or Twitter at @DIYnamicsTeam.

## Using an External Power Supply

The LEGO-Based Tables are powered by batteries driving the motor at a constant speed. The external power supply approach enables driving the motor using wall power and provides the ability to make fine adjustments to rotation rate. These features are beneficial for experiments such as Taylor Columns that require either a low rate of rotation or precisely changing speed mid-experiment. **Disclaimer: Be careful with experiments involving wall power and water in close proximity. We include a GFCI in the required components for safety.**

## Capturing Rotating Frame Footage

The LEGO-Based Tables provide a rotating tank platform for experiments that model the behavior of planetary fluid bodies. Audience members are encouraged to take a hands-on approach to observe and analyze fluid motions then tie them to the real world. However, viewers must contend with observing and analyzing fluid motions whilst abstracting away motion from rotation itself. The rotating frame camera mount enables capturing footage from a perspective inside the system looking down on the tank as it rotates. This feature is beneficial because it makes accessible fluid motions independent of rotation. Further add-ons enable livestreaming footage from the rotating frame allowing viewers to make real-time observations and analysis.

This PDF describes how to mount a camera in the rotating frame above the tank.

## Switching Wheels

The LEGO-Based Tables offer the flexibility to switch wheels driving the lazy susan. Analogous to a higher gear ratio, using a larger wheel will increase rotation rate and vice versa. The Technics Table, designed to provide a more stable platform compared to its predecessor, features an adjustable arm that can be calibrated to different wheels.
