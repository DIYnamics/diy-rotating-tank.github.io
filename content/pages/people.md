## Core Contributors

**Spencer Hill** (Postdoc, UCLA Dept. of Atmospheric and Oceanic
Sciences)<br>Along with Juan Lora, Spencer is co-leading the overall
DIYnamics project.  He loves using rotating tanks to teach core
science concepts, and his dream is to put a DIYnamics rotating tank
kit in every science classroom in the country. [Link to Spencer's

**Juan Lora** (Postdoc, UCLA Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and Space
Sciences)<br>Along with Spencer Hill, Juan is co-leading the overall
DIYnamics project. He is interested in using science demos to
illustrate abstract physical phenomena in tangible and exciting ways,
and to bring the joy of science to non-scientists and students of all
backgrounds (and maybe help inspire a few future scientists). [Link to
Juan's webpage](http://staff.epss.ucla.edu/~jlora/index.html)

**Sean Faulk** (Graduate student, UCLA Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and
Space Sciences)<br>Sean helped write the lab instructions and organize
the first outreach trips for the DIYnamics project. He studies
climates on other planets and loves going out to schools to play with
rotating tanks and help students learn about planetary atmospheres!

**Jonathan Aurnou** (Professor, UCLA Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and
Space Sciences)<br>Jonathan considers few things as satisfying as
developing inexpensive, portable rotating tables for teaching core
geoscience topics.  Thus, he is so pleased to be a part of the
DIYnamics project. [Link to Jon's

**Norris Khoo** (Undergraduate, UCLA Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and
Space Sciences)<br>Norris designed the DIY Rotating Tank and wrote its
PDF instructions. He created the outreach project website and
instructional videos with the help of Spencer Hill.

**Raul Reyes** (Undergraduate, UCLA Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and
Space Sciences) Raul created the [baroclinic
eddies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nACitkIqNs) video under
Juan's guidance.

## Outreach Event Volunteers

**Ashley Shoenfeld** (Graduate student, UCLA Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and
Space Sciences)<br>Ashley is currently studying the ice moons of
Jupiter and Saturn, and is a volunteer for the DIYnamics project. She
believes outreach is one of the most important aspects of being a
scientist, and genuinely loves teaching. She is passionate about
science and hope she can impart that passion onto others.
