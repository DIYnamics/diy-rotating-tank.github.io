Here we provide materials for teachers that enable them to use the
DIYnamics Kits to teach effectively.

This assumes that you've already assembled your table and
are familiar with its basic operation. If not, check out this 
[page](kits.html) for ordering, assembling, and operating
instructions.

## Check out our [Middle School Teaching Guide PDF]({static}../pdfs/diynamics_teaching_guide.pdf)
Our guide to teaching with the DIYnamics Kits at the middle school
level provides an overview of several experiments than can be
performed using the tables, the physical concepts that each
one is meant to demonstrate, images and links to videos showing their
real-world analogs, and questions for the students to keep them
thinking critically throughout. No prior knowledge of fluid dynamics,
etc. by the instructor or students is required.

Our YouTube channel features instructional videos on getting started with
the DIYnamics Kits and performing a host of experiments.
