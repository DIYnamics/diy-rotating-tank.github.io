Here we provide materials for teachers that enable them to use the
DIYnamics table to teach effectively.  No prior knowledge of fluid
dynamics, etc. is required.

This assumes that you've already assembled your DIYnamics table and
are familiar with its basic operation.  If not, check out [this
page](table.html) for ordering, assembling, and operating
instructions.

# Middle school teaching guide
Our guide to teaching with the DIYnamics table at the middle school
level provides an overview of several experiments than can be
performed using the DIYnamics table, the physical concepts that each
one is meant to demonstrate, images and links to videos showing their
real-world analogs, and questions for the students to keep them
thinking critically throughout.

The guide is available both online and in a PDF format:
