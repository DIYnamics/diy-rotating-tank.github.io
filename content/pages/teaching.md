Title: Teaching with the DIYnamics rotating table
Slug: teaching

Here we provide materials for teachers that enable them to use the
DIYnamics table to teach effectively.  No prior knowledge of fluid
dynamics, etc. is required.

This assumes that you've already assembled your DIYnamics table and
are familiar with its basic operation.  If not, check out [this
page](/table.html) for ordering, assembling, and operating
instructions.

This document provides an overview of several geophysical fluid
dynamics (GFD) experiments than can be performed using the DIY
Rotating Tank. The teaching guide includes background information
detailing GFD concepts. Demonstrational videos can be found on our
