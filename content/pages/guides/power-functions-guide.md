Title: Setting Up and Using LEGO Power Functions Components
Slug: power-functions-guide

Here we describe how to set up and use LEGO Power Functions components
for the non-variable and variable speed configurations of the DIY
Rotating Tank.

# Fixed Motor Speed

## 1. Attach the motor's wire to its receptor on the Battery Box

These are highlighted by the blue boxes in the images below.

## 2. Slide the orange switch on the Battery Box in either direction

One direction spins clockwise and the other direction spins
counterclockwise.  To turn the motor back off, just return the switch
to the middle.

# Variable Motor Speed (requires optional components)
## Attach the wire emanating from the IR Receiver to its receptor on the Battery Box

Both segments highlight in red below.

## 1. Attach the motor's wire to either receptor on the IR Receiver

Both segments highlighted in blue below.  It doesn't matter which
color you choose.

## 2. Move the orange switches on the IR Remote and IR Receiver to the same number

Switches are highlighted in green below.  It doesn't matter which
number, as long as they are the same on both.

## 3. Turn on the battery box as described above.

Note that, unlike when the motor was directly connected to the
battery, the motor won't start right away.

## 4. On the IR Remote, press the red square button labeled with the color of the receptor on the IR remote that the motor is connected to

So if the motor is connected to the blue recptor, press the button
with the blue line underneath it (i.e. the one on the right).  If,
instead, the motor is plugged into the red receiver, press the button
with the red marking (i.e. the one on the left).

## 5. Turn the dial on the side of the red button you just pushed.

The motor should start turning.  Note that there is sometimes a delay
of roughly one second between turning the dial and the motor's
response.

The more you turn the dial in one direction, the faster the motor will
spin.  To make it spin slower, turn the dial in the opposite
direction.  Each tick of the dial will change the speed slightly,
until it's at full speed in either direction.
