Title: Operating the DIYnamics Table
Slug: table-operating-guide

Here we describe how to combine the OXO turn table and LEGO assembly
to create the DIY Rotating Tank.

## 1. Place the OXO turn table on a level surface.

## 2. Place a sheet of rubber adjacent to the OXO turn table
A jar opener such as http://a.co/9Z6tq8t will work well.  The sheet
of rubber keeps the motor wheel from being pushed away from the table
edge.

## 3. Place the LEGO assembly on the sheet of rubber
And position the wheel so that it remains in contact with the OXO turn
table.  Check from the side and ensure that the wheel is pressing only
against the black band and not against the white base of the OXO turn
table.  Move wheel on axle as necessary to achieve this.

## 4. Switch on the battery pack and have fun!
The DIY Rotating Tank is now ready to use.  Visit [our

# Troubleshooting
## Why does the LEGO assembly lose contact with the OXO turn table?
This can occur for several reasons.  Try the following steps:
- Ensure that the LEGO assembly is pressing against the OXO turn table
  and is held in place by the adjacent sheet of rubber.
- Position the LEGO assembly such that the beam supporting the motor
  is pointed roughly to the OXO turn table center (as shown by blue
  line in image below).
- Double check to ensure that the LEGO assembly wheel is only in
  contact with the OXO turn table black band.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the optional components used for?
The optional components allow users to switch the speed of the DIY
Rotating Tank motor as it is running.  The LEGO Power Functions IR
Receiver and IR Speed Remote Control enable speed of rotation to be
incremented along 7 steps.  This ability provides the opportunity to
study additional aspects of fluid dynamics (i.e. Taylor Columns as
shown in https://youtu.be/7GGfsW7gOLI)

## Can I use pieces other than the ones detailed in the instructions?
Yes.  There are many combinations of LEGO pieces that can be used to
achieve the same goal.  The design previously described is open for
customization and parts can be switched out as appropriate
(i.e. replace the current wheel with a larger one to increase speed of
rotation).
