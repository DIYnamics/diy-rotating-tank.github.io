some of the technical jargon.  It's also probably suitable for older
audiences that don't have a strong science background.)

# Background
Fluids are everywhere on our planet.  The water in the ocean, the air
in the atmosphere, and even the rock and metal deep beneath the
Earth’s surface are _all_ fluids.

It doesn’t seem like it to us, but since the planet is always
rotating, these fluids are _always rotating_ too, resulting in oceanic
and atmospheric circulations and swirling liquid metal at our planet’s
core that generates the Earth’s magnetic field.

As a result, it is important for us to understand the impact of
rotation on fluid motions, which we call **geophysical fluid
dynamics**!  The term _geophysical_ refers to the physics at work on a
rotating planet; _fluid_ refers to the fluids mentioned above, like
air and water; and _dynamics_ refers to motion.  Together then,
_geophysical fluid dynamics_ refers to the movement of fluids on a
rotating planet.

In this lab, we **model** geophysical fluid dynamics using a rotating
tank of water.  Models help us describe and test our scientific
understanding of phenomena we see in nature.  Here, the tank represents
the planet and the water in the tank represents the atmosphere (or the
ocean, or the planet’s core).

Earth in a small spinning tank of water_

Models, though, are rarely perfect – and ours isn’t either.  Take a
moment to ask yourself:

1. What does our model properly capture about the natural world?
2. What does our model _not_ capture about the natural world?  What are
   the major differences between our model and the atmosphere itself?

There are many answers to these questions, but one major difference
between our model and the real world is **scale**, or the
representation of size.  The actual Earth is huge, but a rotating tank
is small enough to sit on a desk.  So the tank can’t exactly reproduce
all of our observations of nature.  Think about the following:

1. The Earth’s radius is approximately 6370 km.  What is the horizontal
   scale of our tank model?
2. The depth of the troposphere—the part of the atmosphere where
   weather takes place—is roughly 10 km.  What is the vertical scale of
   our water model?

Our model also allows us to investigate the ways that fluids transport
material.  One way is through **diffusion**, where particles move from
regions of high concentration to low concentration within the
fluid.  Another way is **advection**, where the fluid itself _carries_
particles with it as it moves.  We can model these modes of transport
using colored food dye as a **tracer** for fluid motions.  A tracer is
simple something that gets transported by the fluid.  Ocean currents,
for example, are fluid motions that can be traced and are visualized
in this video: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3827

Understanding the fluid motions of our world is of great importance to
scientists and engineers across the world.  Research institutions and
governments invest substantial resources into the study of geophysical
fluid dynamics.  Before we go further, take another moment to ask:

1. Why do you think it would be important for us to study the behavior
   of geophysical fluids?
2. Can you recall a time in your life when geophysical fluids affected
   _you_?

Fluid motions in the atmosphere and ocean have a major impact on our
planet’s **climate** and the **life** that inhabits it.  Winds in the
atmosphere determine temperatures and precipitation by carrying heat
and moisture across large distances, creating distinct ecosystems for
life.  Ocean currents draw up nutrients to the surface, spawning
plankton blooms that sustain large marine ecosystems.

For all of Earth’s history, changes in these kinds of
ocean/atmospheric currents and circulations have led to corresponding
changes in climate that disrupt ecosystems and even drive biological
evolution.  We refer to such climates of the ancient past as
_paleoclimate_.  Earth’s modern climate is currently undergoing a
period of very fast changes, so understanding paleoclimate can help us
to predict where our climate system may be headed.

Beyond the atmosphere and ocean, fluid motions in the planet’s
interior also impact life.  Motions of super hot liquid iron in the
core generate Earth’s magnetic field, which protects us from the
harmful particles released by the Sun.

Our model helps us study not just Earth’s atmosphere, but also
atmospheres on other planets.  The massive storm systems and swirling
clouds observed on the gas giants of the Solar System (Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), such as Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, are
examples of fluid motions driven by rotation.  Models similar to the
ones we use in this lab can help us learn more about these features
and effectively study faraway planets that we can’t physically go to
ourselves.

We focus here on geophysical fluid dynamics, but similar physics apply
to more exotic fluid motions too, like rotating stars and galaxies.

# Experiments

When doing rotating tank experiments, we have to let the tank rotate
for some time so the water can properly _spin up_.  When the tank first
starts rotating, the water on the outside is going faster than the
water near the center because **friction** from the tank walls is
pulling it along.

But after a few minutes, all the water will be rotating at the same
speed.  The more water you have and the bigger your tank, the longer it
takes to spin up!

## Experiment 1: Rotating Columns

1. In a non-rotating tank of water, drop a single blob of dye and
   observe.
    1. First, before dropping it, what do you think will happen to the
       dye?
    2. Now after you’ve dropped it, how would you describe the
       movement and structure of the dye in the tank?

2. Now begin rotating a tank of fresh water, wait a couple minutes for
   the water to spin up and then, as before, drop in a single blob of
   dye and observe.
    1. Before doing so, what do you think will happen this time?
    1. Now how would you describe the movement and structure of the
       dye?
    1. Do you notice a change from the non-rotating experiment?  If so,
       how would you describe it?

3. Pump up the speed of the tank and wait a couple minutes for it to
   spin up.  Drop in a single blob of another color dye and observe.
    1. Before you drop it, how do you think the dye will behave?
    1. Now after you’ve dropped it, do you notice a change in the
       movement and structure of the dye as compared to the more
       slowly rotating experiment?
    1. What can you conclude about the effect of rotation on the
       movement and structure of the dye?

In non-rotating experiments, the dye moves fairly quickly in all
directions and has little structure.  The transport is dominated by
diffusion.  However, rotating dye moves more slowly and forms vertical
columns – the faster the rotation, the smaller the radius of the
columns.  In this case, diffusion is limited, and the rotation
organizes the flow into columns.

_Physical analog: This experiment provides an effective model for
planetary interiors.  In planetary interiors of rotating planets,
fluids form columns that are aligned with the axis of rotation.  These
columns can create circulating electric currents that generate
magnetic fields._

## Experiment 2: Vortices

1. In a non-rotating tank, spray in fine dye patches with spray
   bottles if available.  Then with differently colored dyes, add in a
   couple more blobs.  Using _one or two_ strokes of a pen or a finger,
   mix the colors.
    1. Before doing so, what do you think will happen to the colors?
    1. Now after you’ve mixed the colors, what do you observe?
    1. How would you explain your observation?

2. Refill the tank with clean water now.  Begin rotating the tank and
   wait a few minutes for the water to spin up completely.

3. As before, spray in fine dye patches with spray bottles if
   available and a couple more blobs with differently colored
   dyes.  Now mix the colors with _one or two_ strokes of a pen or
   finger.
    1. Again, before mixing, ask yourself what you think will happen?
    1. Now after you’ve mixed the colors, what do you observe?
    1. What do you notice when you observe from the side of the tank?
    1. Can you draw connections between this experiment and Experiment
       1?
    1. What might your observations represent in the natural world?

You may observe swirling patterns from the colored dye.  These are
called **vortices** (plural of **vortex**), or **eddies** (plural of
**eddy**).  They show up readily in rotating fluids.  In this model, we
generate vortices _mechanically_, meaning we physically stir the fluid
to create the turbulence.  But vortices can also be generated by other
sources of turbulence – hurricanes, for example, are large weather
systems in the tropics that are the result of rising hot air in a
rotating atmosphere.

Vortices also occur in the ocean, where they are commonly called
**gyres** if they’re large.  Ocean gyres concentrate nutrients to
promote plankton blooms, but they can also concentrate trash: The
Great Pacific garbage patch is the result of a gyre in the Pacific
Ocean that spans from Asia to the American west coast and is known for
the high concentrations of plastics and chemical sludge gathered at
its center by ocean currents.

_Physical analog: Vortices are typical in stirred fluids and are a
fundamental component of turbulent flow in the atmosphere and
oceans.  Major storms and ocean gyres are examples of vortices driven
both thermally and mechanically._

_Note: Tornadoes develop from large storms, but their rotation is not
due to planetary rotation._

## Experiment 3: Spinning Dye Curtain

1. Begin rotating the tank.

2. After a minute, before it’s spun up, rather than a single blob in
   one place, drop in a streak of dye from the center of the tank to
   the outside edge.
    1. Before doing so, what do you think will happen to the streak of
       dye?  How do you think it will behave differently from just a
       single blob?
    1. What do you observe happening to the streak?
    1. How would you explain your observation?

Looking from the side, you can see the dye forms curtains, or
sheets.  Since rotation aligns fluids with the rotation axis, a streak
of dye forms a curtain, whereas a blob of dye forms only a column.  The
vortices from Experiment 2 looked like curtains from the side as well,
and were unable to mix well because of that structure.

_Physical analog: Relevant to oceanic circulations.  Rotation creates
what’s called an Ekman boundary layer near the surface and bottom
floor of the ocean where friction affects the velocities of fluid
motion._

## Bonus Experiment: Convection

In doing the previous experiments, you might have noticed small
instabilities at the surface, tiny swirls forming a honeycomb type of
pattern.

1. If you missed them, perform Experiment 2 in the sun or shine a
   flashlight onto the surface of the spinning water.
    1. How would you describe the surface as compared to the same
       experiment run without sunlight or a flashlight?
    1. What do you think is causing the observations that you see?
    1. What do you think your observations might represent in the
       natural world?

{% img /images/guides/teaching-guide/tank-evap-driven-convection.png 600 Convection %}

These observations are the result of **convection**.  Heat, from the
sun or the flashlight, is responsible for the tiny vortices.

The heat evaporates the water at the surface, which _cools_ the
surface water.  Because colder material is denser, the surface water
sinks while the water beneath rises.  This convection is a form of
stirring, so it too forms vortices under the influence of rotation.

_Physical analog: Convection is enormously important for transferring
heat in the atmosphere and ocean, as well as within the Earth’s
interior where it helps drive plate tectonics.  This experiment shows
tiny, upside-down versions of hurricanes!_
