DIYnamics develops inexpensive apparatuses for teaching fundamental
concepts in Earth sciences, with an emphasis on geophysical fluid
dynamics (GFD), in classrooms from the elementary school to university
levels.  We provide assembly instructions, lesson plans, and
instructional videos to enable students and teachers to experiment
with Earth science concepts by doing their very own GFD experiments.

Please explore this website (via the links at the top of this page)
for information regarding our mission, rotating tank designs, educator
resources, past outreach events, and more.

This is where we post all of our videos: instructions of how to
assemble and operate the tables, guides to performing particular
experiments, and demonstrations of various science concepts using
various tanks!
