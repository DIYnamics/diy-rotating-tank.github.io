DIYnamics has taken off far beyond what any of us expected when Jon,
Juan, Norris, and I got it off the ground in early 2017.  Now, in late
2019, we're happy to introduce some new members to the core DIYnamics
team and provide updates on those of us still around and some alumni
who have moved on to other exciting pursuits.  All of this can be
found on our freshly updated
[People](https://diynamics.github.io/people.html) page.
