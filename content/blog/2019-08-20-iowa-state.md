I purchased and built a DIYnamics rotating tank and used it in my
undergraduate Dynamics I course at Iowa State University (ISU) during
the 2019 spring semester.  Six experiments were conducted throughout
the semester: 1) Solid body rotation, 2) Dye stirring/Rossby number,
3) Baroclinic eddies, 4) Taylor Proudman effect, 5) Fronts, and 6)
Ekman layers.  I led the first experiment on solid body rotation while
the other five experiments were co-led by one to three students in the
class.  The experiments were quite successful overall and will
continue to be used in dynamics and other courses at ISU. Some
highlights, including photos and videos, for each experiment are shown
below.

Some issues to address for future improvement are discussed below. Any
feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Baroclinic eddies: The baroclinic eddies experiment was not as
successful as the others due to the lack of a flat bottom on the
rotating tank and possibly the use of a too small of a cold can at the
center.  Anyone else have similar problems?

Lack of flat bottom: One student constructed a flat bottom for one of
the two tanks that worked quite well for the experiments but over the
semester the bottom absorbed water so a more solid flat bottom is
planned to be constructed in the future.  Any ideas out there for how
to do this affordably?

Fronts: The fronts experiments was the most difficult experiment to
execute due to the fact that the salty dyed water in the center kept
leaking slightly into the exterior fresh clear water.  We tried several
methods and the one that worked best was to use A LOT of petroleum
jelly to seal the bottom and prevent leaking (following MIT’s weather
in a tank) but it still leaked.  Additionally, the can was removed
possibly too abruptly and induced extra momentum. Any suggestions for
how to get a better seal?
