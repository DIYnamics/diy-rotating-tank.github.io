Summary: DIYnamics happily welcomes new members to our core team and updates the whereabouts of existing members and alumni.
---

DIYnamics has taken off far beyond what any of us expected when Jon,
Juan, Norris, and I got it off the ground in early 2017.  Now, over
three years later, we're happy to introduce some new members to the
core DIYnamics team and provide updates on those of us still around
and some alumni who have moved on to other exciting pursuits.  All of
this can be found on our freshly updated
[People](/pages/people.html) page.

These additions are long overdue --- Alex, Jordyn, and Henry each have
been doing fantastic work for the DIYnamics efforts for a long time
already.  But better late than never!

## Alex Gonzalez

Alex joined the DIYnamics project in September 2019. He loves using
rotating tanks in the fluid dynamics classes he teaches at ISU. His
goal is to transition to placing more focus on applications rather
than theory in his classes. He is excited about using the DIYnamics’
rotating tanks in outreach activities to inspire a new generation of
scientists, especially those from underrepresented STEM groups. [Link

## Jordyn Moscoso

Jordyn is a graduate student in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences
department studying oceanography and ocean dynamics. She is excited to
be a part of the DIYnamics team and is working to bring DIYnamics into
the curriculum in the AOS department. She is also a member of the
Society of Women Geoscientsts and uses DIYnamics to give hands on
experiences to women, girls, and people of other classically
underrepresented genders in STEM.

## Henry Gonzalez

Henry Gonzalez is currently serving as the SPINLab Project Manager and
Space Magnetism Lab Manager, developing/coordinating everything from
spacecraft instruments to geophysical fluid dynamics experiments.  His
extensive knowledge in prototyping has paved the way to new modeling
systems for understanding the interiors and atmospheres of
planets.  Furthermore, he is working on the Henry III (H3) Model which
will be a portable geoshysical system that will be used for classroom
teaching of advanced concepts as well as outreach at public events and
interactive K-12 STEM demonstrations.
