_Norris, Carlyn, and Oliver hard at work at EYU!  Norris demonstrated
how to build the DIYnamics kits, Carlyn demonstrated how baroclinic
instability creates eddies that transfer heat around the tank, and
Oliver used a record playwer to show how centrifugal instability
pushes chia seeds outward once rotation is turned on._

Early in November, the DIYnamics team returned to Exploring Your
Universe (EYU) at UCLA.  EYU is the largest outreach event for the
Division of Physical Sciences every year, and it involves nearly every
department.  This year the DIYnamics tent included core team member
Norris and our newest core team member Jordyn, as well as help from
two volunteers, UCLA graduate student Francisco Spaulding-Astudillo,
UCLA undergraduate student Carlyn Schmidgell, and Oliver from the
Geffen Academy.

This year there were four different sections at the booth all showing
different aspects of Do-It-Yourself dynamics!

1. Norris demonstrated how to build the DIYnamics motor using legos
   and showed the difference between a rotating and non-rotating tank.
   This experiment shows how the effect of rotation works to organize
   flow into eddies!
2. Carlyn showed how we use the DIYnamics setup to demonstrate how
   eddies exchange heat around the tank.  This demonstration was built
   to show how eddies move warm water and air from low latitudes to
   high latitudes, like for example to the margins of Antarctica.
3. Oliver showed centrifugal instability.  This instability occurs
   when fluid spins very quickly, pushing all of the fluid outward
   toward the edges of the tank.
4. Jordyn (that's me) demonstrated 2D turbulence using the AOS
   rotating tank.

While not all of the steups you see here are built using Legos, the
purpose of DIYnamics is to show that household objects (like a record
player) can be used to simulate the dynamics and flows on planets!

_Jordyn is showing how the effect of rotation works to create vortices
in the flow when a fluid is rotating.  When a little energy is added,
or the fluid is disturbed by running a pen through the flow, the blobs
of dye stretch and move and organize into coherent vortices!_

A huge thank you to all of our volunteers, the UCLA Departments of
Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences and of Atmospheric and Oceanic
Sciences, the Society of Women Geoscientists, the EYU organizers, and
good old Jon Aurnou and the rest of the SPINLab for help!  And an
equally huge thank you to all of the wonderful kids and parents who
visited our booth.  See you all in the fall for EYU 2020!
