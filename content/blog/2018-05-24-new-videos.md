Summary: We have posted new videos to our YouTube channel providing "how-to" instructions for our core demonstrations, including recording them from the rotating frame.

At long last, we have figured out a cheap and easy way (a.k.a. the
DIYnamics way!) of capturing footage of demonstrations on the
DIYnamics table from the rotating frame.  A simple tripod for phone
cameras sits on the DIYnamics table, with its three legs surrounding
the tank in the middle.  The phone can be fastened to the tripod in
two ways.

1. Use the detachable clip that comes with the tripod to fasten the
   phone into place, and then orient it to point down towards the
   tabletop.  The footage won't be from directly overhead, but it
   still looks good.
2. Use duct tape to fasten the camera into place between the three
   tripod legs.  With enough tape, you can create a surprisingly
   sturdy base that will keep your phone in place even at fast
   rotation rates.

In either case, be sure to get the camera into place **before**
filling the tank!  That way, if you accidentally drop the phone while
setting it up, it won't end up taking a bath!  Once the phone is
fastened into place with either method, it should be pretty secure,
even when the table is rotating.  But no matter what, you're
ultimately hanging an expensive phone in air directly (or almost
directly) above a tank of water, so be careful throughout!  (Here's
where our lawyers would have us put in a disclaimer about not being
liable for damages blah blah...if we had lawyers.)

We created new "recipe" videos to show several demonstrations using
this new capabality.  Here's the one for baroclinic instability:

And one for the behavior of non-rotating fluids:
