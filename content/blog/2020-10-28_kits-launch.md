Summary: DIYnamics has launched a major overhaul with three new kits and accompanying guides that range from a beefed-up Lego table to a nearly research-grade 3-foot diameter device.

The DIYnamics [Lego Table](/pages/lego.html) has proven to be a really valuable tool in
teaching fundamentals of atmospheric circulations, ocean currents,
planetary interior flows, and other core geoscience concepts.  Its low
cost, ease of ordering, assembly, and operation, and the simple fact
that it is mostly made out of toy Lego pieces help make the underlying
science seem approachable and fun to learn all the way down to the
elementary school level.  And at the other end of the educational
spectrum, its use in undergraduate and graduate courses continues to
expand across the U.S. and beyond: this semester with many
institutions teaching remotely due to COVID-19, at least two courses
(at Harvard and UCLA) have provided Lego Tables for each of their
students to use remotely from their own homes --- including multiple
students in China.  (More to come about these endeavors in future
posts.)

At the same time, through our own uses and events and from reports
back from users in the wild, we've come to find some limitations of
the original design.  For one, on repeated or extended use, sometimes
the motor arm will detach from the main assembly entirely...not great
in the middle of a demonstration!  Another is that some OXO tables can
develop a tilt or slow spot, leading to tank-wide sloshing and/or the
rotation rate not staying constant.  Finally, for rotating tanks at
least there's no denying that bigger is better, and so the 6" diameter
tanks that are most commonly used with the Lego Table can only
generate so much of a "wow" factor compared to much bigger tanks.

Spurred by these limitations, over the past couple years the DIYnamics
team --- most of all Norris, Taylor, Henry, and Jon --- have been
developing upgraded rotating tank platforms.  The result of their hard
work is three new "kits", as we're now calling them, ranging from a
beefed-up Lego table to a nearly research-grade, 3-foot diameter tank
(but that's 100% portable).  We're happy to introduce these new kits
--- the [Technics Table](/pages/lego.html), the [DJ
Table](/pages/dj.html), and the [HT3](/pages/ht3.html).  A series of
posts will follow this introductory one, each describing one of the
new kits in more detail.

The devices are only so helpful without instructions on how to build
and operate them, and so the team has also created PDF and video
guides for each device.  Along the way, we (mostly Norris) also
created guides for commonly needed "peripherals" like how to
livestream rotating frame footage --- these were inspired by ingenious
DIY solutions created by team members Alex and Marianna.  These too
are now all available via our [website](/pages/kits.html) and
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUHxOSVY4G4OFbF8XL1qUg)

We encourage you to check out the new materials now, and to look out
for our followup posts describing each kit in more detail, all coming
soon!
