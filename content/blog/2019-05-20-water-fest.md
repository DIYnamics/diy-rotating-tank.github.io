XEP, the graduate student organization for UCLA’s Atmospheric and
Oceanic Sciences department (AOS), teamed up with DIYnamics for the
Children’s Water Festival held at UC Irvine in late March.  Over 7,500
elementary school students attended this two day event, where students
learned about different elements within the water cycle through
different twenty minute presentations.

This year, the focus of our demonstrations was on the Pacific Garbage
Patch and the underlying mechanisms that help contribute to the growth
of the patch in the ocean.  We started our demonstrations by talking
about the water cycle, reinforcing the point that both water and the
trash that water can bring along with it can eventually run into the
ocean!

**What happens to the trash once it gets into the water?**  Well...that
depends on the material.  We used a large tank with different objects
to teach about density and buoyancy.  Some of our objects floated above
the water, some of the objects sank, and some things float within the
tank --- showing that the Pacific Garbage patch is not only a problem at
the very surface of the ocean.

**Why is the Pacific Garbage Patch located where it is?** Earth’s
rotation!  Here we used the DIYnamics tanks to show that the rotation
of the Earth influences ocean currents, which help to push the garbage
into one centralized patch.  We modeled this using rotating tanks as
our "ocean" and dye as our "garbage".  Without the rotation, the
"garbage" was able to spread uniformly, all across the "ocean", but
with rotation the dye formed a "patch".

students to make their own hypothesis about how the "garbage" would
behave with and without rotation._

We had so much fun spending two days with students and teachers from
classrooms all over Orange County - we can’t wait for next year!
Thanks to DIYnamics for teaming up with us for this amazing event!!!
