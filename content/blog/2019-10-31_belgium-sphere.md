_Visualizing wind shear in the lab planet by slightly changing the
rotation rate using the Lego IR remote._

Our group at the [Royal Observatory of
Belgium](https://www.astro.oma.be/en/) studies the dynamics of fluid
layers inside rotating planets and moons.  It is very difficult to
imagine the kind of complex flows that we deal with.  To help us with
that, we built a miniature model of a fluid planet in our lab.
Rotation is of major importance in the study of planetary fluid
dynamics.  With our lab planet, we wanted to visualise at least
qualitatively how the fluid flow changes when the rotation speed
varies in time.  We needed our ‘planet’ to be as transparent as
possible and we also needed a way to control its rotation with some
level of precision.

_Closeups of the components of the lab planet: (first image) the base
and bearings, (second image) the acrylic globe._

We set to work building our lab planet using a 14" diameter acrylic
globe, the same kind as used for outdoor lighting.  We used an
aluminium disc as a rotating platform mounted on a spherical ball
bearing, all resting on a PVC stand.  We still needed a way to control
the rotation and that was when we heard about DIYnamics and thought it
would be a perfect match for our purpose!

_A beautiful wave-2 pattern has emerged in this video.  Wave-2 means
that the wave pattern that circles the globe has (roughly speaking)
two peaks and two valleys._

In the past, in order to visualise the currents in fluids, scientists
used Kalliroscope fluid, a rheoscopic fluid developed by Paul Matisse
in 1966, unfortunately not available anymore.  We considered mica
powder and other alternatives that ended up being not so great
compared to Kalliroscope fluid.  However, Daniel Borrero-Echeverry
from Willamette University devised an [ingenious
way](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5045053) [1] to get the same rheoscopic
effect as Kalliroscope, simply using shaving cream!  We were able to
obtain large quantities of rheoscopic fluid, about 22 kg (or 48
pounds), which we used to fill the acrylic globe.  The technical
service from the observatory helped us with the machining of the
aluminium disc platform.  The globe is simply glued (with RTV) to the
aluminium disc.  We made a threaded hole through the centre of the
disc which we use for filling/draining the globe.

_Making Barbasoloscope in four easy steps (with pictures ordered left
to right then top to bottom): (1) dispense the Barbasol, (2) add
water, (3) mix, (4) let rest.  (There's a little more to it after that.  See [this DIYnamics YouTube video]() for more._

Our setup is very close to the traditional DIYnamics except we don’t
use the Lazy Susan platform.  We use the motorised lego wheel to drive
the rotation via the aluminium disc platform.  The lego motor is
powerful enough to spin the whole device!  Mesmerising flow patterns
appear when the spin rate is changed slightly, which we do via the IR
remote.  In the videos you can hear the motors whirring and change
pitch as we slow down or spin up the globe, you can see clearly the
shear in the flow caused by the accelerating/decelerating globe
surface in contact with the fluid.

planet rather than a Lazy Susan._

If we let the globe spin for a while at a constant rate, the fluid
will eventually spin at the same rate as the globe, in sync, with no
or very little flow in the interior as indicated by the absence of any
patterns in the fluid. This might take 5 to 10 minutes to achieve.
If we reduce the speed of the globe just a notch, turbulence will
develop straddling the equator, induced by Görtler vortices most
likely.  However, if the fluid is still not yet spinning in unison
with the globe surface, turbulence develops within a very well defined
band, which we can see in the videos.  We can’t claim we understand
all features we see in the flow but we do recognise many, some of the
them resembling patterns we see in Jupiter, Saturn (think of the polar
hexagon), or the Earth’s atmosphere.

_Teaching with the lab planet at Open Door Day at the European Space
Agency centre, Noordwijk, the Netherlands._

Our lab planet has been a real success during our outreach campaigns,
more than we anticipated!  We have had already a number of open days
here at the Observatory, as well as in the Brussels Planetarium and
last year we took the device to the annual open door day at the
European Space Agency’s centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.  During
these sessions we engage a general audience and discuss various topics
related to fluid dynamics at the planetary scale.

The lab planet is a reality thanks to Antony Trinh, Jeremy Rekier,
Santiago Andres Triana, the technical service at the Royal Observatory
of Belgium, and of course the DIYnamics team for their brilliant idea!
