During this past summer, core DIYnamicist Jon Aurnou and a group of
fellow DIYnamicists and members of Jon's SPINLab worked with UCLA's
Office of Instructional Development (since renamed to the UCLA Center
for the Advancement of Teaching, or CAT) to produce four amazing
videos that are now live on our YouTube channel (and embedded in this
post below the text).  The videos show how to build and use our
classic Lego table, how to build a version of our upcoming Whale
table, how to create "barbasoloscope" fluid for visualization, and how
to perform various demonstrations on the Whale.

CAT has an amazing studio space on UCLA's campus where the videos were
filmed.  I crashed the production for an hour or so to see the pros
(i.e. Kim and Sean from OID) and the semi-pros (the rest of us) at
work and capture some behind-the-scenes photos.  Later on, Norris,
Henry, Yufan, and Susanne each recorded their voice overs for their
video.  Then, OID took everything and edited down to four excellent
videos.

We're extremely grateful to CAT for this opportunity, in particular to
Sean Cruser and Kim Cohen for their excellent camerawork, direction,
and editing.  We would love to make more high-level videos like this
moving forward...Hollywood, look out!  UCLA is just a few miles away
after all :)

_OID Video #1: Norris describes and shows how to build the DIYnamics
Project's LEGO Table, for use at all levels in teaching basic ocean
and atmospheric type fluid dynamics_

_OID Video #2: Henry Gonzalez walks you through how to set up a
Sherline CNC Rotary Table Indexer (https://www.sherline.com).  We are
using this Sherline system as a base for the DIYnamics 1 meter
diameter "Whale" table_

_OID Video #3: Yufan Xu makes a batch of "Barbasoloscope"
visualization fluid, approximately following the recipe given in
Borrero-Echeverry et al. Physics of Fluids, 2018_

_OID Video #4: Susanne Horn carries out experiments on the DIYnamics 1
m Whale Table.  Because we did not correctly filter out the oils from
this batch of Barbasoloscope, it is somewhat difficult to see the full
glory of the Barbasoloscope in action.  Whoops!_
