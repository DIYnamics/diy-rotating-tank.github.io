_[Note: This post is part of a new series we've started, [Field
Reports]({category}Field Reports), where students, teachers, and other
DIYnamicists tell us (and you) in their own words how they are using
DIYnamics in their schools and communities.  -Spencer]_

Saturdays are for science at the Independence Seaport Museum in
Philadelphia! A group of Princeton PhD students, Abigale Wyatt,
Allison Hogikyan and Tsung-Lin Hsieh, from the Geosciences department
and Atmosphere and Ocean Sciences program have been visiting the
museum regularly to give demonstrations using the DIYnamics table.

visitors about how our demonstrations correlate to real-time ocean and
atmosphere circulations._

Within the recently opened exhibit “River Alive” that emphasizes how
local Philadelphians are impacted by and affect the Delaware River, is
the “Fisharium,” a perfect lab for demos using the rotating tank set
up. The space comes with a lab bench, faucet, and some friendly fish
to keep us company. Using velcro to stabilize the lego motor allows us
to quickly set up two rotating tanks and a stationary beaker to
demonstrate the impact of rotation on water’s motion.

_Visitors to the museum come in all shapes and sizes. This group of
adults was fascinated by the baroclinic instability experiment that
demonstrates how rotation plus a temperature difference can generate
unique physical structure._

The museum’s interest is in all things sea-related, including exhibits
on boat making, US Naval history and even a new tattoo exhibit. It’s a
great space to engage with local visitors about science in a casual
environment. Our table is also a nice addition to the museum’s already
diverse biology experiments and provides an opportunity for anyone to
ask about our current research. The setting is perfect for both solo
visitors and large groups, giving us space to adjust for everyone to
have a fully hands on experience.

_A group of visiting Girl Scouts stops by our table to talk about
ocean circulation. After watching the dye spread and diffuse in the
still tank on the right, they’re taking turns adding dye to the
rotating beaker._

It has been a great opportunity for us to chat with the public about
our science and hone our scicomm skills. We’ll be continuing our
collaboration with the museum into the next school year so if you’re
in the Philadelphia area on a Saturday afternoon, come check us out!
