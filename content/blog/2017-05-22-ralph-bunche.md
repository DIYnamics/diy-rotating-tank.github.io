Summary: The DIYnamics team brought their rotating tables to the 7th grade science class at Ralph J. Bunche Middle School in Compton, CA.

On May 22nd, 2017, we visited Ralph Bunche Middle School in Compton,
California. Similarly to our La Tijera K-8 School events, we first
introduced students to the field of geophysical fluid dynamics
(GFD). We sought to teach students about the importance of models in
studying science and, to this end, we showed how our assortment of
rotating tanks can be used to illustrate aspects of GFD. Both the
group experiments and individual DIY Rotating Tank experiments went
great!

_Sean provides a lecture on GFD and the use of models in studying
science. Lecture slides can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ClYEmFAEATzG2iHZ8uqD2pzgEYSqbrYZD0xDRfuADzk/edit?usp=sharing)._

_Katie and other members of the DIY Rotating Tank team demonstrate how
rotating tanks are a simple yet effective tool for studying GFD. Among
other experiments, students created a vertical column and learned how
it mirrors the interior of rotating planets._

_Juan provides a demonstration of the mechanical creation of
vortices, a.k.a. the swirling patterns in the dye. When students dip
their hands into the large rotating tank, the physical disturbance
results in turbluence. Other sources of turbluence like the movement
of heat can also generate vortices._

_Juan shows how an uneven temperature distribution can influence
GFD. An ice bucket at the center of the tank and rotation result in
the formation of vortices. This behavior reflects the weather patterns
of the Earth's middle latitudes. A video of this demonstration is
available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G26klqKKCmM)._
