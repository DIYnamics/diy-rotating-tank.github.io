Summary: In addition to the LEGO revamp in the form of the Technic Table, DIYnamics has recently developed two brand new systems emphasizing portability, ease of assembly, and broad-range rotational capability: the DJ Table and the HT3.

_Introducing the DJ Table! As the first DIYnamics table that
incorporates portability in the design, the DJ Table is the perfect
kit for schools and universities who want to showcase advanced fluid
dynamics phenomena in their classrooms and lecture halls._

The DJ Table is a three part system consisting of modified cart, a
high-torque record player, and a tank.  The modified cart has standard
utility shelf posts such that the height can be adjusted by one inch
increments and the only tool needed for assembly is a mallet.  The
cart is also the only part of the system that requires assembly and is
easily a one-person job.  We offer a variety of options for both new
and used record players, but highly suggest scouring the internet (and
local garage sales) for second-hand record players.  Record players
that lack a tone arm or functioning audio ports may seem like junk to
music enthusiasts, but are perfect for fluid dynamics experiments!
Finally, we provide a few different options for tanks.  While we
recommend our custom-designed tanks with centered holes for mounting
to record players, if you have your own tank, we also provide options
for elevation blocks such that you don't have to worry about the
record pin being in the way.  Overall, the pricing for the DJ Table
ranges from $600-$1500 depending on your choice of record player and
tank.  This averages to about 1/5 the price of our more advanced
system, the HT3.

The DJ Table is well suited for schools looking to share a kit between
classrooms or lecture halls.  The DJ Table's modified cart has locking
wheels and the system maintains a minimal footprint for easy storage.
Situated on the cart, the star of the DJ Table is the high-torque
record player which can generate rotation rates from 17 RPM to 117 RPM
(depending on the specific model).  This rotation range makes the DJ
Table perfect for rapidly rotating experiments such as:

- Taylor columns
- Column collapse and frontogenesis
- Ekman pumping
- Centrifugal forcing
- Corner vortices (in a square tank)
- Spin up demonstrations
- Columnar (vertical) convection

An example of columnar convection can be seen below.  The
visualization is accomplished with green food dye distributed using a
spray bottle.

_Introducing the HT3!  The HT3 is our most ambitious kit to date.
Boasting a powerful turntable, meter-scale tank, and built in
visualization deck, this system can be used for demonstrating
geophysical fluid dynamics everywhere from a classroom or lecture hall
to a museum or a outreach science festival._

The HT3 is a multi-part system optimized for portability,
accessibility, and ease of assembly.  The custom acrylic HT3 tank has
a maximized diameter while still fitting through a standard doorframe
and comes pre-drilled with mounting holes on a 2.5-inch lip for the
HT3 visualization deck.  The visualization deck consists of a
polycarbonate plate held above the tank with three legs and it allows
users to place sensors in the rotating frame of the tank, including
phones and cameras to record and stream video.  The tank sits on a
powerful turntable, capable of maintaining a consistent low rotation
rate with over 25 gallons of water in the tank.  Finally, we encourage
those who want to invest in an HT3 to purchase the THC (Taylor-Henry
Cart) - a multi-purpose cart designed by our team to make the HT3 a
broadly useful and accessible teaching device.  Low to the ground to
enable children to look over the tank, the THC sits on 5-inch locking
casters which turns the HT3 into an all-terrain vehicle.  With the
THC, the HT3 system can easily be carted from classroom to classroom,
or across campus from lecture hall to lecture hall.  The lower deck on
the THC is ideal for storing your power, as well as dyes and other
visualization tools.  Additionally, the cart's handlebar can be bent
to provide a platform for controls, or completely stowed under the
lower deck to make 360 degrees of viewing available.  Most
importantly, the entire system (both the HT3 and the THC) can be
assembled without any power tools!  The cost of the HT3 kit with the
THC is $4,800.

The HT3 system is a flexible device that was designed with large-scale
outreach in mind, but with careful set-up and leveling, it has the
potential for being a research device.  The visualization deck can
also be used to house measurement instrumentation including motion
tracking and thermometry systems.  The HT3 turntable is capable of
rotating from 0.16 RPM to 13.3 RPM which makes this system ideal for
experiments such as:

- Thermal wind flows
- Ocean Garbage Patches and Ekman Pumping
- Baroclinic instability
- Columnar convection
- Mechanical turbulence (i.e., Great Red Spot experiments)
- Non-rotating evaporative convection (solar-style convection)
- Rossby waves

The following video shows a baroclinic instability demonstration on
the HT3.
