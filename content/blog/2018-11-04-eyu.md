Over the course of the roughly 5 hour event, dozens of kids
successfully built their own, usually with very little help from us
required._

On November 4, 2018, the DIYnamics team made a triumphant return to
the [Exploring Your Universe](https://www.exploringyouruniverse.org/)
(EYU) science fair held every fall at UCLA.  Old-timers Spencer and
Norris and newcomers Calvin and Santiago had a blast spending the day
helping kids and their families learn about rotating fluids using the
DIYnamics materials.

_Calvin using a spinning top to help these EYU visitors get a more
intuitive feel for why rotation effects fluids like water and air.
Just like a top stays upright if its spinning but falls over if it's
stationary, motions within rotating fluids get aligned with the
rotation axis, while non-rotating fluids move in all directions._

Like our inaugural appearance at EYU in 2017, we had three different
sections of our booth, all of them going simultaneously.

1. Build your own DIYnamics motor: Using the DIYnamics official
   printed instructions, visitors got to assemble their own DIYnamics
   motors.  Norris kept watch and helped out when necessary, but
   mostly kids were able to build them start-to-finish on their own!
2. Rotating vs. non-rotating tanks: Calvin and Santiago led our
   classic demonstration comparing how dye behaves when dropped into a
   rotating tank vs. a non-rotating one.  They also made great use of
   spinning tops to illustrate how rotation makes things (including
   fluids) stand up straight.
3. Winter storms using the big square tank: Once every hour, Spencer
   performed the demonstration of "baroclinic instability" using a
   bigger tank --- the same one that we used to create our
   [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5bnmaYOFerk)
   [videos](https://youtu.be/b4f0plA3_Bg) on the same topic.  With a
   paint can filled with ice in the middle, water gets cooled in the
   middle of the tank compared to the outer edges.  This temperature
   contrast combined with rotation gives rise to beautiful swirling
   eddies that act to transfer heat from the warm section to the cold
   section...just like the big winter storms in Earth's atmosphere!

first-time DIYnamics volunteers, and they did an amazing job!
Especially given that we didn't have as many people this year (only 4
total).  Thanks guys!_

EYU also marked the debut of our amazing new LEGO-based DIYnamics logo
(image below).  How cool is that?

_Our awesome new LEGO-based DIYnamics logo.  We're definitely going to
start using this on the website and everywhere else we can!  Thanks to
Jon Aurnou for the idea, and Norris for actually building it._

A huge thanks to the EYU organizers and volunteers, the UCLA
Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences staff who helped us
setup, Jon Aurnou and the rest of the SPINLab for help (and including
us in their pizza order!), and of course to the wonderful kids and
parents who came to our booth.  See you in 2019 for EYU Round 3!
