Summary: Nick Lutsko, an assistant professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, describes his collaboration with the Colegio La Esperanza elementary school in Tijuana, Mexico, using DIYnamics to teach (remotely and in Spanish!) their students some fundamentals of rotating fluids.

“How can I describe hurricane dynamics in rudimentary Spanish?”  This
was one of the questions I asked myself a few weeks ago while giving a
virtual demonstration of some DIYnamics experiments in (limited)
Spanish to the fifth and sixth graders at the Colegio La
Esperanza. The Colegio is a kindergarten and primary school in the La
Esperanza Colonia of Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Sited at the
top of a hill about nine miles south of the San Diego border, the
school was founded in 1989 by the non-profit Americas Foundation with
the goal of creating a social institution in an unorganized and
unincorporated yet highly populated area. The school’s curriculum has
a strong focus on the arts, and the Foundation works with volunteers
and other nonprofit organizations and schools in both San Diego and
Tijuana to stage cultural events and educational programs across the
border region.

I met the director of the Americas Foundation, Christine Brady, at a
virtual reunion event for Princeton alumni last year --- Christine
graduated from Princeton with a physics degree, and I did my
Ph.D. there. We stayed in touch over the past year, during which the
Colegio transitioned to remote learning in response to the COVID-19
epidemic.  It’s been a very difficult time for the Colegio, as many
students live in households without running water or
electricity.  Christine has led several funding drives to get
wireless-enabled cell phones for all the students who needed one to
follow along in Zoom classes.

_Answering questions after the demonstrations with Profesora Lorena._


The DIYnamics experiments seemed like a fun way to teach the students
a little bit about how the atmosphere and the ocean work, so I reached
out to the DIYnamics team, who very kindly donated two of their
LEGO-based tables to the Colegio.

On the day of the demonstration, the Colegio moved the filming
equipment they use for virtual demonstrations to the ecology
classroom, where I was frantically building Legos (class with the
fifth graders started an hour earlier than I expected).  With
Profesora Lorena helping to explain the experiments and Profesor
José-Luis manning the cameras, we showed the kids Taylor-Proudman
columns and then how fronts develop. Using two cell phones, we had a
top-down view and a cross-section, so we could see the dye trapped in
columns or watch the swirling eddies from above.

It’s always hard to get feedback over Zoom, but the kids seemed to
really enjoy the demonstrations. The sixth-graders in particular asked
lots of questions -- about weather and the oceans, about how
hurricanes and storms work, and about what it’s like to be a
scientist. There were also questions that were harder for me to answer
about the kinds of animals which live at the sea-floor and how long
sharks live. The teachers were also thrilled when they learned that
the kits are staying at the school. My only regret was that I didn’t
spend more time beforehand looking up meteorology terms in Spanish.
