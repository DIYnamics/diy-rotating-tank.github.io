Summary: Jordyn introduces us to the Society of Women Geoscientists organization at UCLA and how they partnered with Project Scientist to teach K-12 girls about planetary fluid motions using a record player.

surface of the water in the tank, and shows how the patterns of dye a
tank develops in contrast to a tank that is not rotating._

DIYnamics made a debut in a partnership with the Society of Women
Geoscientists (SWG) and [Project
Scientist](https://projectscientist.org/) on November 11th, 2019, at
UCLA. SWG is a group at UCLA formed to support women and other
underrepresented genders in the geosciences.  Members and allies in
the group come from the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS)
department, the Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences (EPSS)
department, the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability
(IoES), and the Geology department.  Project Scientist is a community
of girls and women excited about science.  Their mission is to expose
a diverse population of girls to high quality STEM academy that
inspires confidence in their persuit of learning throughout the year.

Partnered with the SPINLab, Ashna and Jewel used common household
goods, like a record player to demonstrate how the fluids on the Earth
and other planets behave in the presence of rotation.

_Some volunteers from the Society of Women Geoscientists (SWG) with
the girls from Project Scientist. The girls joined us for experiences
in SPINLab --- where DIYnamics was born --- ranging from understanding
how rotation changes how fluid flows the to seeing how ozone is formed
in the atmosphere, to coding eddies and vortices moving around in a
channel.  SWG was happy to support and meet our future colleagues!_

The future scientists who visited UCLA were between the ages of 4 and
12, and we were so impressed by their questions about how the earth
works, and their ideas for more experiments that we can run using
these rotating tanks!  We hope to expand our demonstrations next year
to include building the DIYnamics kits and run more hands on
experiments with Project Scientist next year!
