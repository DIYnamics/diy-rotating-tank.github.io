On April 20, 2019, Norris and other members of the SPINLab visited sunny Santa Barbara to present
at the thirteenth annual [SoCal Fluids](https://sites.google.com/view/socalfluids2019/home) student
symposium. Graduate students from throughout Southern California met to share their research in
diverse fields of fluid dynamics. For his presentation, Norris took the opportunity to describe the
utility of the DIYnamics table for STEM education. We believe that physical models provide a
tangible connection to the large scale processes impacting our atmosphere and oceans, helping
students develop a scientific approach to the world.

Norris provided an overview of his favorite experiment, baroclinic instability (please watch our
[video](https://youtu.be/2tIVOK9wjI4) for a more detailed guide). Begin the experiment by placing
a frozen can in the middle of a rotating tank of warm water. The cold source and warm body,
analogous to the Earth's poles and lower latitudes respectively, create a temperature gradient.
The blue water, chilled by the cold source, is dense and pushed out as the tank rotates. Meanwhile,
the red water, heated by the warm body, migrates to the center to fill the void. This process
continues and results in the formation of large circular structures or eddies. Baroclinic
instability defines much of the large scale behavior of Earth's atmosphere in the northern
hemisphere.

Thank you to the SoCal Fluids 2019 organizers for providing the opportunity to share our project!
And thank you to other participants for their interesting presentations and valuable insight
regarding improvements for our material!
