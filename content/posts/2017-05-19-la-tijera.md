Summary: The DIYnamics team brought rotating tables large and small to La Tijera K-8 Charter School in Inglewood, CA, to teach basics Earth's atmospheric and oceanic motions.

On May 12th and May 19th, 2017, we visited La Tijera K-8 School in
Inglewood, California. We introduced seventh and eighth grade students
to the study of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) and how this pertains
to our everyday lives. Like many other areas of science, studying GFD
involves the extensive use of scientific models and, to this end, we
brought a range of rotating tables to showcase key concepts. Everyone
had a lot of fun during group demonstrations and individual
experiments involving the DIY Rotating Tank. At the end, we talked
with students about how they can pursue careers in science.

_Sean and Spencer discuss how GFD can be studied using smaller scale
models. Lecture slides can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ClYEmFAEATzG2iHZ8uqD2pzgEYSqbrYZD0xDRfuADzk/edit?usp=sharing)._

_Juan demonstrates the creation of vortices using our large rotating
tank nicknamed the "White Whale." When students placed their hands in
the water, vortices were mechanically generated (seen as swirling
patterns of the colored dyes). Other forms of turbulence can also
create vortices._

_Juan provides a demonstration on the effects of temperature
distributions on rotating fluids. At the center of the square tank is
an ice bucket, which cools the nearby water. The resulting temperature
contrasts in the water induce vortices analogous to the weather
patterns of the Earth's mid-latitudes. We used a camera and projector
to show the results from the rotating point of view. A video of this
demonstration can be found

_Alex and other members of the DIYnamics team guided students in using
the DIY Rotating Tank to model GFD concepts. The students were able to
compare the movement of dye in rotating versus non-rotating bodies of
fluid. Rotating columns are analogous to the movement of molten iron
in the Earth's outer core._

taken during the May 12th (left) and May 19th (right) trips. It was a
pleasure to work with Mr. Stephenson, and he played a large part in
making the events run as smoothly as possible. This included visiting
UCLA beforehand to learn about GFD and how it relates to his
curriculum._
