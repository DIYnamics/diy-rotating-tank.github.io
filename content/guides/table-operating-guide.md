Title: Operating the DIYnamics Table
Slug: table-operating-guide

Here we describe how to combine the OXO turn table and LEGO assembly
to create the DIY Rotating Tank.

Place the OXO turn table on a level surface.

Place a sheet of rubber adjacent to the OXO turn table (a jar opener
such as http://a.co/9Z6tq8t will work well). The sheet of rubber is
intended to keep the LEGO assembly in place.


Place the LEGO assembly on the sheet of rubber and position the wheel
so that it remains in contact with the OXO turn table. Check from the
side and ensure that the wheel is pressing only against the black band
and not against the white base of the OXO turn table. Move wheel on
axle as necessary to achieve this.



The DIY Rotating Tank is now ready to use. Switch on the battery pack
and have fun! Visit our website https://diynamics.github.io/ or our

the project and the types of experiments that can be
performed. Contact

# Troubleshooting
- Q: Why does the LEGO assembly lose contact with the OXO turn table?
- A: This can occur for several reasons. Try the following steps:
  - Ensure that the LEGO assembly is pressing against the OXO turn
    table and is held in place by the adjacent sheet of rubber.
  - Position the LEGO assembly such that the beam supporting the motor
    is pointed roughly to the OXO turn table center (as shown by blue
    line in image below).
  - Double check to ensure that the LEGO assembly wheel is only in
    contact with the OXO turn table black band.

# Frequently Asked Questions
- Q: What are the optional components used for?
- A: The optional components allow users to switch the speed of the
  DIY Rotating Tank motor as it is running. The LEGO Power Functions
  IR Receiver and IR Speed Remote Control enable speed of rotation to
  be incremented along 7 steps. This ability provides the opportunity
  to study additional aspects of fluid dynamics (i.e. Taylor Columns
  as shown in https://youtu.be/7GGfsW7gOLI)

- Q: Can I use pieces other than the ones detailed in the
  instructions?
- A: Yes. There are many combinations of LEGO pieces that can be used
  to achieve the same goal. The design previously described is open
  for customization and parts can be switched out as appropriate
  (i.e. replace the current wheel with a larger one to increase speed
  of rotation).
