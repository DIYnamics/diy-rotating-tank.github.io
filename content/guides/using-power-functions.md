Title: Setting Up and Using LEGO Power Functions Components
Slug: power-functions-guide

Here we describe how to set up and use LEGO Power Functions components
for the non-variable and variable speed configurations of the DIY
Rotating Tank.


# Fixed Motor Speed
- Attach the end of the wire emanating from the vertically mounted XL
  Motor to its receptor on the Battery Box (both segments highlighted
  below).

- To turn on the XL Motor, slide the orange switch on the Battery Box
  in either direction (one direction spins clockwise and the other
  direction spins counterclockwise).
- Return switch to the middle to turn off the XL motor.

# Variable Motor Speed
- Attach the end of the wire emanating from the IR Receiver to its
  receptor on the Battery Box (both segments highlight in red below).
- Attach the end of the wire emanating from the vertically mounted XL
  Motor to either receptor on the IR Receiver (both segments
  highlighted in blue below).

- To use the IR Speed Remote Control and IR Receiver, make sure that
  the orange switch on both components is set to the same number
  (toggles are highlighted in green below).
- Turn on the XL motor by sliding the orange switch on the Battery Box
  in either direction (return to middle to turn off the XL
  motor). Note that the XL motor starts spinning after input to the IR
  Speed Remote Control.
- If the XL Motor is connected to the blue receptor on the IR
  Receiver, turn the blue dial on the IR Speed Remote Control to
  change speed. Same applies for the red receptor and dial. Color is
  denoted by a tick mark. May experience some delay between input and
  response.
