Building and experimenting with your own DIY Rotating Tank is fun and easy! Take a look at the following documents to get started.

[Parts](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B28wggH2gQfTWXRVcl9naHVyMzg)  
This document lists the components necessary to build our design. The DIY Rotating Tank is constructed from easily obtainable parts and costs $39.15 in total ($67.13 with optional components). Note that prices reflect April 30th, 2017 figures.

[Instructions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B28wggH2gQfTNWJZMXl2ZFhFZW8)  
This document contains a step by step guide regarding how to build your own DIY Rotating Tank and set up its LEGO Power Functions components. The instructions also include an overview on how to operate the design and general troubleshooting tips. A video version of the instructions can be found [here](https://youtu.be/wKT2NA7kpvk).

[Teaching Guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B28wggH2gQfTY2ZOaXcwUUlCdEE)  
This document provides an overview of several geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) experiments than can be performed using the DIY Rotating Tank. The teaching guide includes background information detailing GFD concepts. Demonstrational videos can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/diyrotatingtank).

[SPINLab](http://spinlab.ess.ucla.edu/)  
The SPINLab at UCLA studies fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in a geophysical context. Members of the lab have created a series of demonstrational [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/spinlabucla) and participate in numerous public outreach events (presentation slides can be found [here](http://spinlab.ess.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Aurnou-TurntableRecipes-EYU2011.pdf)).

[Weather in a Tank](http://weathertank.mit.edu/)  
The Weather in a Tank project by MIT details the use of rotating fluid experiments to gain insight into atmospheric and oceanic processes. A video introduction to the project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/uWdKVpQ94Ns).

[Marshall and Plumb](http://marshallplumb.mit.edu/)  
"Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate Dynamics" by Marshall and Plumb provides an overview of atmospheric and oceanic circulatory processes and their interactions. The website accompanying the textbook describes experiments that provide key insight regarding the behavior of rotating fluids.
