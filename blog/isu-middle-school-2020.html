      <p><em>[Note from Spencer: This post is part of our ongoing <a href="/blog/category/field-reports.html">Field
Reports</a> series, where DIYnamics users across
the country &#8212;- share how they&#8217;ve used the DIYnamics kit and materials
in their local communities.  Also, for this post we do not include
any photos of the actual event, because minors appear and we did not
attain release forms from parents permitting their photos to be used
in this way.  Keep that in mind for your own futurue K-12-facing&nbsp;events!]</em></p>
<p>My name is Natalie Kongable, and I am a senior in high school.  I was
able to purchase and build the DIYnamics rotating table setup.  I used
it with when I was doing research for my Iowa Academy of Science
project.  My project involved collaborating with Professor Alex
Gonzalez from Iowa State University (<span class="caps">ISU</span>) along with two graduate
students.  We selected one experiment (The demonstration of
extratropical cyclones) and I presented it to groups of middle school
aged students (6th through 8th&nbsp;grade).</p>

<p><em>Side views of the extratropical cyclones experiment taken just after the blue dye and then red dye was injected.  [Note from Spencer: for those familiar with thermal wind, notice how this baroclinic eddies simulation actually looks a lot like thermal wind in these shots.  That&#8217;s because these are taken during the initial spin-up phase before the baroclinic eddies have kicked in.  Timescale&nbsp;matters!]</em></p>
<p>The experiments proved to be successful in students understanding of
how cyclones were formed and maintained.  The students I worked with
were from two different schools, including a homeschool, and they
enjoyed the hands-on experiment.  I would love to have more
opportunities to present to students and continue doing outreach to
engage younger students and excite them about the science aspect of
<span class="caps">STEM</span>.  Another thing I would like to try would be to do it with more
groups than middle schoolers; I would like to try it with elementary
students, probably about 2nd or 3rd grade, and continue it with a
variety of ages all the way up to high&nbsp;school.</p>
<p>Although for the most part this was a successful experiment, there was
one improvement I would have made.  I would have tried to find a
better dish that had a flat bottom.  Most of the issues I had were
largely in part due to the slight curve of the bottom. Some of those
problems included the frozen can sliding so it was not in the center
of the dish throughout the entire experiment, and the dye would settle
into the little crevice right around the edge of the dish so no
pattern would be formed.  I believe that these are issues I would be
able to solve if I continued using the apparatus for experiments in
the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>It was lots of fun to be able to interact with and teach the students,
and I truly look forward to continuing with this&nbsp;project.</p>
