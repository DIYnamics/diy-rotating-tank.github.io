      <p>On June 13, DIYnamics' own Prof. Jon Aurnou led an outreach event
featuring our Lego-based rotating tanks at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic
Research Laboratory
(<a href="http://www.ucnrs.org/reserves/sierra-nevada-aquatic-research-laboratory.html">SNARL</a>).
Jon gave a public lecture on his research on Jupiter's jets and
performed demonstrations for before and after the lecture.  The event
was even written up in a full-page article in the community's local
newspaper, <em>The Sheet</em>.  Checkout a PDF
<a href="/pdfs/aurnou_event_article_2017-06.pdf">here</a>; DIYnamics
is featured at the top of page 1 and all of page 23.</p>
<p>Jon utilized a feature of the DIYnamics table that we hadn't in our
prior events: pouring water directly into the OXO lazy susan, rather
than into a container sitting on the OXO.  This utilizes the full 16"
diameter surface, although because the rim is only around 1/2" tall,
only a shallow layer can be attained.  But this is more like Earth's
atmosphere or ocean anyways!  In fact, the true aspect ratio (i.e. the
ratio of how wide they are to how tall they are) of either of these is
even larger -- not far from that of a single piece of paper.</p>

<p>Jon complemented the demonstrations performed on the DIYnamics table
with others using a turntable (i.e. what you use to play vinyl records
or be a legit DJ).  Turntables are another great tool for these
demonstrations.  Like the DIYnamics table, they are portable and
inexpensive compared to custom built tanks primarily used at
universities.  And unlike the DIYnamics table (at least for now), many
have a lever that enables varying the rotation rate by up to +/-10%,
which is needed for e.g. demonstrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_column">Taylor
columns</a>.</p>
<p>(One snag with using record players is the center nub that keeps vinyl
records centered as they spin.  A notch has to be machined out of the
bottom of your tank, or the tank has to be sitting on something like a
platform with legs.)</p>
<p>The whole event was a major success in Jon's eyes, as the crowd seemed
really interested in the hands-on demonstrations.  "Kids loved getting
to operate the table themselves. They kept playing with it until it
got dark outside," Jon said.  "And they made a complete mess and asked
a lot of questions -â€“ a great sign that they had fun and learned
something."</p>
