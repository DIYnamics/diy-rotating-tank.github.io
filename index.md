## **DIYnamics: affordable, accessible Earth science demonstration and teaching materials**

![Intro]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/homepage_slideshow.gif){: .center-image }

DIYnamics develops inexpensive apparatuses for teaching fundamental
concepts in Earth sciences&mdash;with an emphasis on geophysical fluid
dynamics (GFD)&mdash;in classrooms from the elementary school to
university levels.  We provide assembly instructions, lesson plans,
and instructional videos to enable students and teachers to experiment with
Earth science concepts by doing their very own GFD
experiments.

The project is led by a group of scientists and
students at UCLA.

Please explore this website for information regarding our mission,
rotating tank designs, educator resources, past outreach events, and
more.

This is where we post all of our videos: instructions of how to assemble and
operate the tables, guides to performing particular experiments, and demonstrations of various science concepts using various tanks!
