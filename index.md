## **DIYnamics: affordable, accessible Earth science demonstration and teaching materials**

![Intro]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/homepage_slideshow.gif){: .center-image }

DIYnamics develops inexpensive apparatus for teaching fundamental
concepts in Earth sciences -- with an emphasis on geophysical fluid
dynamics (GFD) -- in classrooms from the elementary school to
university levels.  We provide assembly instructions, lesson plans,
and even instructional videos to enable students and teachers to learn
fundamental Earth science concepts by performing their very own GFD
demonstrations.  The project is led by a group of scientists,
students, and professors at UCLA.

Please explore this website for information regarding our mission,
rotating tank design, educator resources, past outreach events, and
more.

## **Check out our [YouTube channel](http://tinyurl.com/diynamicsvideos)!  &#161;V&iacute;deos son disponible en Espa&ntilde;ol!**

It's where we post all our videos: instructions of how to assemble and
operate the table, guides to performing particular demonstrations with
the table, and demonstrations of various science concepts using the
tables and other equipment!
