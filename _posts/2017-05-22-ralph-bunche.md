On May 22nd, 2017, we visited Ralph Bunche Middle School in Compton, California. Similar to our La Tijera K-8 School events, we first introduced students to the field of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD). We sought to teach students about the importance of models in studying science and to this end, we showed how our assortment of rotating tanks can be used to represent aspects of GFD. Both the group experiments and individual DIY Rotating Tank experiments went great!

_Katie and other members of the DIY Rotating Tank team demonstrated how rotating tanks are a simple yet effective tool for studying GFD. Among other experiments, students created a vertical column and learned how it mirrors the interior of rotating planets._

_Juan providing a demonstration on the mechanical creation of vortices or the swirling patterns in the dye. When students dipped their hands into the large rotating tank, the physical disturbance resulted in turbluence. Other sources of turbluence like the movement of heat can also generate vortices._

_Juan showed how uneven temperature distribution can influence GFD. A cold mass was placed at the center of the  tank and rotating the body would result in the formation of vortices. This behavior reflects weather patterns at the Earth's poles._
