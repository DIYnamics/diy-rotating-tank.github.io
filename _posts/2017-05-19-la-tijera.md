On May 12th and May 19th, 2017, we visited La Tijera K-8 school in Inglewood, California. We introduced seventh and eighth grade students to the study of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) and how it pertains to our everyday lives. Like many other areas of science, studying GFD involves the extensive use of scientific models and to this end, we brought a range of rotating tables to showcase key concepts. Everyone had a lot of fun during group demonstrations and individual experiments involving the DIY Rotating Tank. At the end, we talked with students about how they can pursue careers in science.

_Juan demonstrating the creation of vortices using our large rotating tank nicknamed the "White Whale". When students placed their hands in the water, this resulted in the mechanical generation of vortices (expressed as swirling patterns from the colored dye). Other forms of turbulence can also create vortices._

_Juan provided a demonstration on the effect of temperature distribution for rotating fluid bodies. At the center of the square tank was a cold body resulting in flow analogous to weather patterns at the Earth's poles. We used Skype and a projector so that everyone in class could see GFD in action._

_Alex and other members of the DIY Rotating Tank team showed students how the DIY Rotating Tank can be used to model key GFD concepts. The students were able to compare the diffusion of dye in rotating versus non-rotating bodies of fluid. Rotating columns are analogous to the movement of molten iron in the Earth's outer core._

_Group photos of DIY Rotating Tank team members and our host Mr. Stephenson taken during the May 12th (left) and May 19th (right) trips. It was a pleasure to work with Mr. Stephenson and he played a large part in making the events run as smoothly as possible. This included visiting UCLA beforehand to learn about GFD concepts and how it relates to his curriculum._
