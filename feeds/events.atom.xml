&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean leads a demonstration of "baroclinic instability" (a.k.a. the
combination of a strong temperature contrast and rotation that
generates storms on Earth) to El Marino students and parents.  They're
so focused!  We're now using a LEGO Power Functions remote control to
reduce the rotation rate for this demonstration, which makes these
eddies larger and therefore more engaging.  Even with the bigger
eddies, we were also able to shrink the tank compared to previous
attempts, which allows for a little more breathing room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 27, 2018, Ashna, Sean, and Spencer of the DIYnamics team
performed hands-on demonstrations for dozens of kids at the 23rd
annual science fair of the &lt;a href="https://elmarino.ccusd.org/"&gt;El Marino Language
School&lt;/a&gt;, a foreign language-focused
elementary school in the Culver City Unified School District, in
Culver City, CA.  In a cool twist on the traditional elementary
school-level science fair, El Marino's fair featured science posters
and demonstrations both from their own students and from multiple
science groups at UCLA.  So the students got to show off their awesome
science and simultaneously learn about the just-as-awesome science
conducted at the university level.  And they even fed us dinner!
Naturally, this was an event that DIYnamics wasn't going to miss!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/el-marino-2018/el-marino-ashna.jpg" width="600" title="Ashna leading a demo" alt="Ashna leading a demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our newest DIYnamicist, Ashna, with two excited young El Marino
students eager to drop dye into our tanks.  But before they do so,
Ashna makes sure that they make a hypothesis about what they will see
in each tank.  Then, once the dye has been injected, she asks them to
describe what they are seeing, to decide if their hypothesis was
right, and then ultimately link the results back to the underlying
science we're trying to teach.  This gets participants engaged in
active learning throughout the demonstration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came equipped with a handful of our DIYnamics rotating table
platforms, our handy globe, and some LEGO Batman figurines to teach
the students and parents who came by about how Earth's rotation and
temperature contrasts combine to generate the weather patterns that we
know and (sometimes) love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/el-marino-2018/el-marino-spencer-sean.jpg" width="600" title="Spencer and Sean leading a demo" alt="Spencer and Sean leading a demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spencer using an inflatable globe with a LEGO figurine (LEGO Batman,
to be specific) taped onto the north pole to make the connection with
students between the real world and the tanks on the table.  The
DIYnamics table farthest back in this image has another LEGO Batman
taped at its center, sitting on top of a polar stereographic map
(a.k.a. a map centered on the North Pole).  Spencer spins the globe
showing that Batman spins with it, and at the same time Sean spins the
table showing that Batman spins the exact same way there!  We've found
this really helps students make the otherwise difficult connection
between tanks of water and the real world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents were a great bunch too!  One father told us that he is a
pilot, and that our explanation of weather systems using the DIYnamics
was the best one he's ever heard!  Pilots really need to know the
weather to fy safely, so that's no small compliment (if we may say
so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/el-marino-2018/el-marino-bci-closeup.jpg" width="600" title="El Marino students getting a closeup look at baroclinic instability" alt="El Marino students getting a closeup look at baroclinic instability"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Marino students eagerly awaiting the onset of "storms" driven by
the frozen can of tomato paste in the center of the table.  Initially,
all of the blue dye was injected next to the can and all of the red
dye outside of it.  But you can see that the blue dye has moved
outward in places, while the red dye has moved in toward the can.
(Don't be alarmed by the red patch on the hand pointing down at the
tank...one downside of using red dye is that when it gets on hand it
looks like blood!  No DIYnamicists (or students or parents) were
harmed in the making of this demonstration.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Erika M. von Euw of UCLA and the El Marino Language
School PTA for organizing, the many student and parent volunteers at
the event, and most of all the great kids and parents who came to our
table.  We're crossing our fingers that we get a repeat invitation for
next year's fair!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="outreach"></category><category term="K-8"></category><category term="baroclinic instability"></category></entry><entry><title>UCLA Exploring Your Universe (EYU) 2017</title><link href="https://diynamics.github.io/eyu-2017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-05T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-11-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Spencer Hill</name></author><id>tag:diynamics.github.io,2017-11-05:/eyu-2017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The DIYnamics team ran a booth at UCLA's massive public science fair "Exploring Your Universe," featuring demonstrations and kids building their own DIYnamics tables.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/eyu-2017/eyu2017_sean.jpg" width="600" title="Sean leading a demo" alt="Sean leading a demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean leading a demonstration using DIYnamics tables.  The farther
table has a special acryllic sidewall that enables us to fill the
whole table with water.  The nearer one uses a plastic planter tray
that costs a few dollars to achieve nearly the same thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 5, 2017, the DIYnamics team performed hands-on
demonstrations for hundreds of kids at the annual &lt;a href="https://www.exploringyouruniverse.org/"&gt;Exploring Your
Universe&lt;/a&gt; (EYU) event at UCLA.
EYU is basically a massive science fair, with groups from nearly every
science department at UCLA, from astronomers to biochemists,
performing demonstrations to teach kids (and their parents!) about
their science.  Of course, DIYnamics had a booth where we had kids
build our tables, use them to learn about rotating fluids, and also
give more in-depth demonstrations using our larger, custom square
tank.  We had a blast showing off our equipment and teaching science
to hundreds of people in total over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/eyu-2017/eyu2017_norris.jpg" width="600" title="Norris helping kids build their own tables" alt="Norris helping kids build their own tables"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norris helping out as several kids (and an adult!) build their own
motors for the DIYnamics table.  His table was swamped all day; kids
really loved building these!  Who doesn't love building with LEGOs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One highlight of the day was our newest activity, wherein kids got to
create the DIYnamics rotating tank kit themselves!  We provided all of
the needed LEGO parts, along with printouts of our official
instructions of how to assemble the motor.  Dozens of kids went
step-by-step through the instructions, creating the finished product
in just a few minutes every time.  We provided a little guidance here
and there, but mostly they were able to do it all on their own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever somebody finished building their motor, we would then use it
to drive a table in a science demonstration.  The kids loved to hear
us announce their name and to see their creation used to perform a
real-world science experiment.  Overall, this affirmed our belief that
our kit really is easy to build and use, and that the DIY aspect of
the apparatus adds to the connection students make with the science --
if we can learn about something using LEGOs and food coloring, how
hard can it really be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/eyu-2017/eyu2017_juan.jpg" width="600" title="Juan leading a demonstration at EYU" alt="Juan leading a demonstration at EYU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juan demonstrating baroclinic instability using our large square
tank, along with a GoPro in the rotating frame that streams footage to
his iPad.  Look at all those excited faces!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another highlight was demonstrating baroclinic instability in our
larger square tank.  By putting a bucket of ice in the center, we
created baroclinic eddies and added some "Hollywood magic" via a GoPro
mounted in the rotating frame.  The rotating frame footage was
streamed directly to an iPad, rather than to an iPhone + projector as
we had in the past.  As usual, this was a crowd favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/eyu-2017/eyu2017_baroclinic.jpg" width="600" title="Baroclinic instability on the DIYnamics table generated at EYU" alt="Baroclinic instability on the DIYnamics table generated at EYU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baroclinic instability generated on the DIYnamics table using a
frozen can of tomato paste as the cold source at the center.  We were
happily shocked when this worked first try, all while we were getting
setup for the rest of the event!  Huge thanks to Henry Gonzalez for
making the acryllic sidewall that enabled the fluid to span the
table's full width.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in addition to the baroclinic instability demonstration on
the big tank, we managed to get it working for the first time on the
smaller DIYnamics table!  These eddies need a sufficiently large tank
in order to grow (specifically, the tank radius must be appreciably
larger than the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_radius_of_deformation"&gt;"Rossby radius of
deformation"&lt;/a&gt;,
which determines the size of the eddies), and that extra space was
enabled by an acryllic sidewall that Jon installed on one of the
tables with the help of Henry Gonzalez of the UCLA Dept. of Earth,
Planetary, and Space Sciences.  Instead of a paint bucket filled with
ice, we used a frozen can of tomato paste, which also allowed for more
room for the eddies to grow.  We're really excited to try this one
again and ultimately create a lesson plan and videos for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to returning volunteer Chloe Wicker, first time
volunteer Tersi Arias-Young, the EYU organizers, and most of all the
great kids and parents who came to our booth.  We're already looking
forward to EYU 2018!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="outreach"></category><category term="public"></category><category term="baroclinic instability"></category></entry><entry><title>DIYnamics + a record player at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory</title><link href="https://diynamics.github.io/snarl-event.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-13T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-06-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Spencer Hill</name></author><id>tag:diynamics.github.io,2017-06-13:/snarl-event.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;DIYnamicist Jon Aurnou led demonstrations using the DIYnamics table and a record player...and even got written up in the local newspaper!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On June 13, DIYnamics' own Prof. Jon Aurnou led an outreach event
featuring our Lego-based rotating tanks at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic
Research Laboratory
(&lt;a href="http://www.ucnrs.org/reserves/sierra-nevada-aquatic-research-laboratory.html"&gt;SNARL&lt;/a&gt;).
Jon gave a public lecture on his research on Jupiter's jets and
performed demonstrations for before and after the lecture.  The event
was even written up in a full-page article in the community's local
newspaper, &lt;em&gt;The Sheet&lt;/em&gt;.  Checkout a PDF
&lt;a href="{filename}../pdfs/aurnou_event_article_2017-06.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; DIYnamics
is featured at the top of page 1 and all of page 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon utilized a feature of the DIYnamics table that we hadn't in our
prior events: pouring water directly into the OXO lazy susan, rather
than into a container sitting on the OXO.  This utilizes the full 16"
diameter surface, although because the rim is only around 1/2" tall,
only a shallow layer can be attained.  But this is more like Earth's
atmosphere or ocean anyways!  In fact, the true aspect ratio (i.e. the
ratio of how wide they are to how tall they are) of either of these is
even larger -- not far from that of a single piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/snarl/jon-oxo.jpg" width="600" title="Jon using the DIYnamics table" alt="Jon using the DIYnamics table"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

fluids.  Photo credit: Abagael Giles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon complemented the demonstrations performed on the DIYnamics table
with others using a turntable (i.e. what you use to play vinyl records
or be a legit DJ).  Turntables are another great tool for these
demonstrations.  Like the DIYnamics table, they are portable and
inexpensive compared to custom built tanks primarily used at
universities.  And unlike the DIYnamics table (at least for now), many
have a lever that enables varying the rotation rate by up to +/-10%,
which is needed for e.g. demonstrating &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_column"&gt;Taylor
columns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One snag with using record players is the center nub that keeps vinyl
records centered as they spin.  A notch has to be machined out of the
bottom of your tank, or the tank has to be sitting on something like a
platform with legs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole event was a major success in Jon's eyes, as the crowd seemed
really interested in the hands-on demonstrations.  "Kids loved getting
to operate the table themselves. They kept playing with it until it
got dark outside," Jon said.  "And they made a complete mess and asked
a lot of questions -– a great sign that they had fun and learned
something."&lt;/p&gt;

Inglewood, California. We introduced seventh and eighth grade students
to the study of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) and how this pertains
to our everyday lives. Like many other areas of science, studying GFD
involves the extensive use of scientific models and, to this end, we
brought a range of rotating tables to showcase key concepts. Everyone
had a lot of fun during group demonstrations and individual
experiments involving the DIY Rotating Tank. At the end, we talked
with students about how they can pursue careers in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Model" src="{filename}../images/la-tijera/globe-table.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Gyroscope" src="{filename}../images/la-tijera/gyroscope.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean and Spencer discuss how GFD can be studied using smaller scale
models. Lecture slides can be found
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ClYEmFAEATzG2iHZ8uqD2pzgEYSqbrYZD0xDRfuADzk/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="White Whale 2" src="{filename}../images/la-tijera/white_whale_2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juan demonstrates the creation of vortices using our large rotating
tank nicknamed the "White Whale." When students placed their hands in
the water, vortices were mechanically generated (seen as swirling
patterns of the colored dyes). Other forms of turbulence can also
create vortices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="{filename}../images/la-tijera/square-tank.png" width="450" title="The square tank" alt="The square tank"&gt;
&lt;img src="{filename}../images/la-tijera/square-projector.png" width="450" title="The projector" alt="The projector"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juan provides a demonstration on the effects of temperature
distributions on rotating fluids. At the center of the square tank is
an ice bucket, which cools the nearby water. The resulting temperature
contrasts in the water induce vortices analogous to the weather
patterns of the Earth's mid-latitudes. We used a camera and projector
to show the results from the rotating point of view. A video of this
demonstration can be found
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G26klqKKCmM"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Lego 2" src="{filename}../images/la-tijera/lego_2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex and other members of the DIYnamics team guided students in using
the DIY Rotating Tank to model GFD concepts. The students were able to
compare the movement of dye in rotating versus non-rotating bodies of
fluid. Rotating columns are analogous to the movement of molten iron
in the Earth's outer core.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

pleasure to work with Mr. Stephenson, and he played a large part in
making the events run as smoothly as possible. This included visiting
UCLA beforehand to learn about GFD and how it relates to his
curriculum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="outreach"></category><category term="K-8"></category><category term="baroclinic instability"></category></entry></feed>
