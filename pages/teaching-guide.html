      <h2>A Guide to Teaching with the DIYnamics Table at the middle school&nbsp;level</h2>
<p>(This could also be adapted to younger audiences, by de-emphasizing
some of the technical jargon.  It&#8217;s also probably suitable for older
audiences that don&#8217;t have a strong science&nbsp;background.)</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Fluids are everywhere on our planet.  The water in the ocean, the air
in the atmosphere, and even the rock and metal deep beneath the
Earth’s surface are <em>all</em>&nbsp;fluids.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like it to us, but since the planet is always
rotating, these fluids are <em>always rotating</em> too, resulting in oceanic
and atmospheric circulations and swirling liquid metal at our planet’s
core that generates the Earth’s magnetic&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>As a result, it is important for us to understand the impact of
rotation on fluid motions, which we call <strong>geophysical fluid
dynamics</strong>!  The term <em>geophysical</em> refers to the physics at work on a
rotating planet; <em>fluid</em> refers to the fluids mentioned above, like
air and water; and <em>dynamics</em> refers to motion.  Together then,
<em>geophysical fluid dynamics</em> refers to the movement of fluids on a
rotating&nbsp;planet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/guides/teaching-guide/white-whale-epss-newsletter.png" width="600" title="UCLA EYU" alt="UCLA EYU"></p>
<p><em>Students using a rotating tank of water to model geophysical fluid
dynamics at <span class="caps">UCLA</span>’s Exploring Your&nbsp;Universe.</em></p>
<p>In this lab, we <strong>model</strong> geophysical fluid dynamics using a rotating
tank of water.  Models help us describe and test our scientific
understanding of phenomena we see in nature.  Here, the tank represents
the planet and the water in the tank represents the atmosphere (or the
ocean, or the planet’s&nbsp;core).</p>
<p><img src="/images/schematic_earth_vs_tank.png" width="600" title="Schematic showing how we model the whole planet in a tank of water" alt="Schematic showing how we model the whole planet in a tank of water"></p>
<p><em>Schematic showing how we create a <strong>scientific model</strong> of the whole
Earth in a small spinning tank of&nbsp;water</em></p>
<p>Models, though, are rarely perfect – and ours isn’t either.  Take a
moment to ask&nbsp;yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>What does our model properly capture about the natural&nbsp;world?</li>
<li>What does our model <em>not</em> capture about the natural world?  What are
   the major differences between our model and the atmosphere&nbsp;itself?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many answers to these questions, but one major difference
between our model and the real world is <strong>scale</strong>, or the
representation of size.  The actual Earth is huge, but a rotating tank
is small enough to sit on a desk.  So the tank can’t exactly reproduce
all of our observations of nature.  Think about the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Earth’s radius is approximately 6370 km.  What is the horizontal
   scale of our tank&nbsp;model?</li>
<li>The depth of the troposphere—the part of the atmosphere where
   weather takes place—is roughly 10 km.  What is the vertical scale of
   our water&nbsp;model?</li>
</ol>
<p>Our model also allows us to investigate the ways that fluids transport
material.  One way is through <strong>diffusion</strong>, where particles move from
regions of high concentration to low concentration within the
fluid.  Another way is <strong>advection</strong>, where the fluid itself <em>carries</em>
particles with it as it moves.  We can model these modes of transport
using colored food dye as a <strong>tracer</strong> for fluid motions.  A tracer is
simple something that gets transported by the fluid.  Ocean currents,
for example, are fluid motions that can be traced and are visualized
in this video:&nbsp;https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3827</p>
<p>Understanding the fluid motions of our world is of great importance to
scientists and engineers across the world.  Research institutions and
governments invest substantial resources into the study of geophysical
fluid dynamics.  Before we go further, take another moment to&nbsp;ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do you think it would be important for us to study the behavior
   of geophysical&nbsp;fluids?</li>
<li>Can you recall a time in your life when geophysical fluids affected
   <em>you</em>?</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/guides/teaching-guide/phytoplankton-bloom-2.jpg" width="600" title="Phytoplankton Bloom" alt="Phytoplankton Bloom"></p>
<p><em>Phytoplankton bloom from the Barents Sea in the North Atlantic Ocean
captured by a satellite in 2016 (<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=88316">Link to
image</a>)</em></p>
<p>Fluid motions in the atmosphere and ocean have a major impact on our
planet’s <strong>climate</strong> and the <strong>life</strong> that inhabits it.  Winds in the
atmosphere determine temperatures and precipitation by carrying heat
and moisture across large distances, creating distinct ecosystems for
life.  Ocean currents draw up nutrients to the surface, spawning
plankton blooms that sustain large marine&nbsp;ecosystems.</p>
<p>For all of Earth’s history, changes in these kinds of
ocean/atmospheric currents and circulations have led to corresponding
changes in climate that disrupt ecosystems and even drive biological
evolution.  We refer to such climates of the ancient past as
<em>paleoclimate</em>.  Earth’s modern climate is currently undergoing a
period of very fast changes, so understanding paleoclimate can help us
to predict where our climate system may be&nbsp;headed.</p>
<p>Beyond the atmosphere and ocean, fluid motions in the planet’s
interior also impact life.  Motions of super hot liquid iron in the
core generate Earth’s magnetic field, which protects us from the
harmful particles released by the&nbsp;Sun.</p>
<p>Our model helps us study not just Earth’s atmosphere, but also
atmospheres on other planets.  The massive storm systems and swirling
clouds observed on the gas giants of the Solar System (Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune), such as Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, are
examples of fluid motions driven by rotation.  Models similar to the
ones we use in this lab can help us learn more about these features
and effectively study faraway planets that we can’t physically go to&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="/images/guides/teaching-guide/jupiter.jpg" width="600" title="Jupiter" alt="Jupiter"></p>
<p><em>The bands and storms of Jupiter, including the Great Red Spot (<a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1708a/">Link
to image</a>)</em></p>
<p>We focus here on geophysical fluid dynamics, but similar physics apply
to more exotic fluid motions too, like rotating stars and&nbsp;galaxies.</p>
<h1>Experiments</h1>
<p>When doing rotating tank experiments, we have to let the tank rotate
for some time so the water can properly <em>spin up</em>.  When the tank first
starts rotating, the water on the outside is going faster than the
water near the center because <strong>friction</strong> from the tank walls is
pulling it&nbsp;along.</p>
<p>But after a few minutes, all the water will be rotating at the same
speed.  The more water you have and the bigger your tank, the longer it
takes to spin&nbsp;up!</p>
<h2>Experiment 1: Rotating&nbsp;Columns</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In a non-rotating tank of water, drop a single blob of dye and&nbsp;observe.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, before dropping it, what do you think will happen to the&nbsp;dye?</li>
<li>Now after you’ve dropped it, how would you describe the
   movement and structure of the dye in the&nbsp;tank?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now begin rotating a tank of fresh water, wait a couple minutes for
   the water to spin up and then, as before, drop in a single blob of
   dye and&nbsp;observe.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before doing so, what do you think will happen this&nbsp;time?</li>
<li>Now how would you describe the movement and structure of the&nbsp;dye?</li>
<li>Do you notice a change from the non-rotating experiment?  If so,
   how would you describe&nbsp;it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pump up the speed of the tank and wait a couple minutes for it to
   spin up.  Drop in a single blob of another color dye and&nbsp;observe.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before you drop it, how do you think the dye will&nbsp;behave?</li>
<li>Now after you’ve dropped it, do you notice a change in the
   movement and structure of the dye as compared to the more
   slowly rotating&nbsp;experiment?</li>
<li>What can you conclude about the effect of rotation on the
   movement and structure of the&nbsp;dye?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In non-rotating experiments, the dye moves fairly quickly in all
directions and has little structure.  The transport is dominated by
diffusion.  However, rotating dye moves more slowly and forms vertical
columns – the faster the rotation, the smaller the radius of the
columns.  In this case, diffusion is limited, and the rotation
organizes the flow into&nbsp;columns.</p>
<p><em>Physical analog: This experiment provides an effective model for
planetary interiors.  In planetary interiors of rotating planets,
fluids form columns that are aligned with the axis of rotation.  These
columns can create circulating electric currents that generate
magnetic&nbsp;fields.</em></p>

<h2>Experiment 2:&nbsp;Vortices</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In a non-rotating tank, spray in fine dye patches with spray
   bottles if available.  Then with differently colored dyes, add in a
   couple more blobs.  Using <em>one or two</em> strokes of a pen or a finger,
   mix the&nbsp;colors.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before doing so, what do you think will happen to the&nbsp;colors?</li>
<li>Now after you’ve mixed the colors, what do you&nbsp;observe?</li>
<li>How would you explain your&nbsp;observation?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refill the tank with clean water now.  Begin rotating the tank and
   wait a few minutes for the water to spin up&nbsp;completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As before, spray in fine dye patches with spray bottles if
   available and a couple more blobs with differently colored
   dyes.  Now mix the colors with <em>one or two</em> strokes of a pen or&nbsp;finger.</p>
<ol>
<li>Again, before mixing, ask yourself what you think will&nbsp;happen?</li>
<li>Now after you’ve mixed the colors, what do you&nbsp;observe?</li>
<li>What do you notice when you observe from the side of the&nbsp;tank?</li>
<li>Can you draw connections between this experiment and Experiment&nbsp;1?</li>
<li>What might your observations represent in the natural&nbsp;world?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may observe swirling patterns from the colored dye.  These are
called <strong>vortices</strong> (plural of <strong>vortex</strong>), or <strong>eddies</strong> (plural of
<strong>eddy</strong>).  They show up readily in rotating fluids.  In this model, we
generate vortices <em>mechanically</em>, meaning we physically stir the fluid
to create the turbulence.  But vortices can also be generated by other
sources of turbulence – hurricanes, for example, are large weather
systems in the tropics that are the result of rising hot air in a
rotating&nbsp;atmosphere.</p>
<p>Vortices also occur in the ocean, where they are commonly called
<strong>gyres</strong> if they’re large.  Ocean gyres concentrate nutrients to
promote plankton blooms, but they can also concentrate trash: The
Great Pacific garbage patch is the result of a gyre in the Pacific
Ocean that spans from Asia to the American west coast and is known for
the high concentrations of plastics and chemical sludge gathered at
its center by ocean&nbsp;currents.</p>
<p><img src="/images/guides/teaching-guide/north-pacific-gyre-schematic.jpg" width="600" title="North Pacific Gyre" alt="North Pacific Gyre"></p>
<p><em>The North Pacific Gyre and other ocean currents stirred mechanically
by winds and continental boundaries (<a href="https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html">Link to
image</a>)</em></p>
<p><em>Physical analog: Vortices are typical in stirred fluids and are a
fundamental component of turbulent flow in the atmosphere and
oceans.  Major storms and ocean gyres are examples of vortices driven
both thermally and&nbsp;mechanically.</em></p>
<p><em>Note: Tornadoes develop from large storms, but their rotation is not
due to planetary&nbsp;rotation.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/guides/teaching-guide/hurricane-douglas.jpg" width="600" title="Hurricane Douglas" alt="Hurricane Douglas"></p>
<p><em>Hurricane Douglas moving away from the Baja California Peninsula in
2002 (<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=9989">Link to
image</a>)</em></p>
<h2>Experiment 3: Spinning Dye&nbsp;Curtain</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Begin rotating the&nbsp;tank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a minute, before it’s spun up, rather than a single blob in
   one place, drop in a streak of dye from the center of the tank to
   the outside&nbsp;edge.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before doing so, what do you think will happen to the streak of
   dye?  How do you think it will behave differently from just a
   single&nbsp;blob?</li>
<li>What do you observe happening to the&nbsp;streak?</li>
<li>How would you explain your&nbsp;observation?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking from the side, you can see the dye forms curtains, or
sheets.  Since rotation aligns fluids with the rotation axis, a streak
of dye forms a curtain, whereas a blob of dye forms only a column.  The
vortices from Experiment 2 looked like curtains from the side as well,
and were unable to mix well because of that&nbsp;structure.</p>
<p><em>Physical analog: Relevant to oceanic circulations.  Rotation creates
what’s called an Ekman boundary layer near the surface and bottom
floor of the ocean where friction affects the velocities of fluid&nbsp;motion.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Experiment:&nbsp;Convection</h2>
<p>In doing the previous experiments, you might have noticed small
instabilities at the surface, tiny swirls forming a honeycomb type of&nbsp;pattern.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you missed them, perform Experiment 2 in the sun or shine a
   flashlight onto the surface of the spinning water.<ol>
<li>How would you describe the surface as compared to the same
   experiment run without sunlight or a&nbsp;flashlight?</li>
<li>What do you think is causing the observations that you&nbsp;see?</li>
<li>What do you think your observations might represent in the
   natural&nbsp;world?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/guides/teaching-guide/tank-evap-driven-convection.png" width="600" title="Convection" alt="Convection"></p>
<p>These observations are the result of <strong>convection</strong>.  Heat, from the
sun or the flashlight, is responsible for the tiny&nbsp;vortices.</p>
<p>The heat evaporates the water at the surface, which <em>cools</em> the
surface water.  Because colder material is denser, the surface water
sinks while the water beneath rises.  This convection is a form of
stirring, so it too forms vortices under the influence of&nbsp;rotation.</p>
<p><em>Physical analog: Convection is enormously important for transferring
heat in the atmosphere and ocean, as well as within the Earth’s
interior where it helps drive plate tectonics.  This experiment shows
tiny, upside-down versions of&nbsp;hurricanes!</em></p>
