<h2>Our mission: expand and improve teaching of <em>geophysical fluid dynamics</em> (GFD) at all age levels</h2>
<p>What is "geophysical fluid dynamics"?  Let's break it into pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>Geo</strong>”: Earth</li>
<li>“<strong>Physical</strong>”: physics</li>
<li>“<strong>Fluid</strong>”: liquids and gases</li>
<li>“<strong>Dynamics</strong>”: how things move around</li>
</ul>
<p>So GFD = the physics of fluid motions on Earth and other planets.  The
fluids we're most interested are the air in the atmosphere, the water
in the ocean, and the liquids within a planet's interior.</p>
<h2>Our tool: affordable, accessible rotating tank-based teaching</h2>
<p>It turns out that the rotation of the Earth is extremely important for
these fluid motions.  Fortunately, as the schematic at the top of this
page illustrates, we can model Earth's atmosphere (and ocean, and
interior) using a spinning tank of water.  So DIYnamics develops cheap
and effective tank platforms and provides information both on how to
build them and on how to use them as effective teaching tools.</p>

<a href="./02_resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p>
<h2>Our outreach events: taking the DIYnamics rotating table into real classrooms</h2>
<p>We have visited several schools in the Los Angeles area and taught
students about the use of models in scientific research.  We used an
assortment of rotating tanks (from our large "White Whale" to the main
DIYnamics rotating table).</p>

<h2>DIYnamics history</h2>
<p>DIYnamics was initiated by a team of professors, postdocs, graduate
students, and undergraduate students at UCLA, all in either the
Departments of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, or Atmospheric
and Oceanic Sciences.  One of us (Jon Aurnou) had been using
traditional rotating tank platforms and vinyl record players to
perform demonstrations for several years and had been looking for a
cheaper, more portable alternative.  In the 2016 spring term, a group
of three undergraduates led by Jon developed an initial prototype of
the DIYnamics table made primarily of wood and powered by a small
motor connected to an Arduino.</p>
<p>In early 2017, one of us (Norris Khoo) realized that the same
functionality could be acquired with essentially what became the final
design: a lazy susan driven by a LEGO Power Functions motor.  The name
"DIYnamics" was chosen at some point in the first half of 2017.</p>
