      <p>The DIYnamics team is composed of students, professors, and
scientists, originally all at <span class="caps">UCLA</span> but now with the core team spanning
numerous institutions across America and with users spanning across
the&nbsp;world!</p>
<h2>Co-directors</h2>
<p><img src="/images/people/spencer-hill.jpg" width="200" title="Spencer Hill" alt="Spencer Hill"></p>
<p><strong>Spencer Hill</strong> (Postdoc, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia
University)<br>Spencer loves using rotating tanks to teach core
science concepts, and his dream is to put a DIYnamics rotating tank
kit in every science classroom in the country. <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~shill">Link to Spencer&#8217;s&nbsp;webpage</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/people/Aurnou.jpg" width="200" title="Jonathan Aurnou" alt="Jonathan Aurnou"></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Aurnou</strong> (Professor, <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and
Space Sciences)<br>Jonathan considers few things as satisfying as
developing inexpensive, portable rotating tables for teaching core
geoscience topics.  Thus, he is so pleased to be a part of the
DIYnamics project. <a href="http://epss.ucla.edu/people/faculty/543/">Link to Jon&#8217;s&nbsp;webpage</a></p>
<h2>Team members (in alphabetical&nbsp;order)</h2>
<p><img src="/images/people/mirjam-glessmer.jpg" width="200" title="Mirjam Glessmer" alt="Mirjam Glessmer"></p>
<p><strong>Mirjam Glessmer</strong> (oceanographer and science communicator)<br>
Mirjam introduced #KitchenOceanography in her oceanography classes
back in 2011 as a way to give students the opportunity to see
phenomena right in front of them instead of only describing them
mathematically, and to help them practice observational, discussion
and lab skills, using only materials that are available in most
kitchens. Discovering the DIYnamics rotating tables meant that
students could now even manipulate and observe the influence of
rotation on large-scale ocean circulation, which Mirjam has introduced
in Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean classes in both Kiel (Germany)
and Bergen (Norway).  <a href="https://mirjamglessmer.com/">Link to Mirjam&#8217;s&nbsp;website</a></p>

<p><strong>Alex Gonzalez</strong> (Assistant Professor, Dept. of Geological and
Atmospheric Sciences, Iowa State University)<br> Alex joined the
DIYnamics project in September 2019. He loves using rotating tanks in
the fluid dynamics classes he teaches at <span class="caps">ISU</span>. His goal is to
transition to placing more focus on applications rather than theory in
his classes. He is excited about using the DIYnamics’ rotating tanks
in outreach activities to inspire a new generation of scientists,
especially those from underrepresented <span class="caps">STEM</span> groups. <a href="https://tad.ge-at.iastate.edu/">Link to Alex’s

<h2>DIYrotate</h2>
<p><img src="/images/people/david-james.jpg" width="200" title="DJ James" alt="DJ James"></p>
<p><strong>David (<span class="caps">DJ</span>) James</strong> (PhD student, <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Department of Earth,
Planetary, and Space Sciences) <br> <span class="caps">DJ</span> has reanimated the DigiPyRo
(now <code>diyrotate</code>) Python script to work in Python 3.  This script
digitally rotates a movie around a selected axis point.  This allows
students to experiment with the Coriolis acceleration by selecting
their own digitally rotating reference frame, and is proving to be an
excellent tool for a number of different DIYnamics exercises.  He is
starting his PhD work with Prof. Lars Stixrude at <span class="caps">UCLA</span> in the fall of&nbsp;2020.</p>

<h2>Alumni</h2>
<p><img src="/images/people/Sean.png" width="200" title="Sean Faulk" alt="Sean Faulk"></p>
<p><strong>Sean Faulk</strong> (Student, David Geffen School of Medicine,
<span class="caps">UCLA</span>)<br>Sean helped write the lab instructions and organize the first
outreach trips for the DIYnamics project.  As a Ph.D. student in the
<span class="caps">UCLA</span> Dept. of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, he studied
climates on other planets and moons, most of all Saturn&#8217;s moon Titan.
And he loved going out to schools to play with rotating tanks and help
students learn about planetary atmospheres!  After finishing his
Ph.D. in 2018, Dr. Faulk made the leap from outer space to human
bodies, as he is now pursuing his <span class="caps">M.D.</span> as a medical student at the
<span class="caps">UCLA</span> Medical&nbsp;School.</p>

<h2>Event Volunteers and DIYnamics&nbsp;users</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the core team members are just the tip of the DIYnamics
iceburg!  What matters most is how much the DIYnamics materials get
used &#8220;in the wild&#8221; by teachers, students, and science communicators,
in classrooms, exhibits, public events, and on and&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="/pages/blog.html">blog</a> for posts on various events
that the Core Team and other groups have put on using the DIYnamics
materials.  Those posts provide shout outs to the main people involved
and supporting cast for each&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Are you using DIYnamics in your class or science outreach event?  We
would love for you to guest-author a Field Report post on it!  It can
be as short as a couple paragraphs or as long as you wish.  The more
pictures the better, and we can even include videos by uploading them
to our YouTube page and embedding them within the post.  Just shoot us
a message at <a href="mailto:diynamicsteam@gmail.com">diynamicsteam@gmail.com</a>
and we&#8217;ll work with you to get it&nbsp;posted!</p>

<h2>Origin&nbsp;story</h2>
<p>The idea for DIYnamics came from Jon Aurnou&#8217;s Simulated Planetary
INteriors Lab (a.k.a. SPINLab), in the <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Department of Earth,
Planetary, and Space Sciences.  SPINLab has been conducting outreach
using rotating tanks for years, but Jon was yearning for a cheap,
portable version of the equipment that people without the equipment
(and budget) of his highly specialized lab could easily attain.  There
was (and still is) <span class="caps">MIT</span>&#8217;s excellent Weather in a Tank platform, but
that costs several thousand dollars and requires custom&nbsp;assemply.</p>
<p>Work began in earnest in 2016 within SPINLab, and late in that year
Spencer, Juan, and Sean joined the fold.  But it really took off in
early 2017 when, due to a scheduling snafu, Norris got stuck observing
one of our meetings and &#8212;- essentially on the spot &#8212;- came up with
the <span class="caps">LEGO</span>-based design that was far superior to the wood-based
prototype we were working on up to then.  Within days we had a working
prototype that is, with only a few modest tweaks, the DIYnamics
<span class="caps">LEGO</span>-based&nbsp;table.</p>
