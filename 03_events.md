DIYnamics team members teach students at local school about
geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) and the use of scientific models.  We
bring rotating tanks for demonstrations of topics such as the creation
of vortices and weather patterns.  The DIYnamics rotating tanks, being
so cheap, portable, easy to assemble, and easy to operate, enable
every student to literally get their hands wet by helping to perform
the demonstrations themselves.

Check out the links below for summaries and imaes from our past
events.  Still want to find out more, including how to run your own
event?  Reach out to us at
